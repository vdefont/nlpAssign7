positive	the best movie of all time !
negative	eat my shorts .
positive	overated but awsome movie thrilling and intense
positive	this is probably one of the greatest comedies ever ! you have to watch it more than once to catch everything , but once you get it all , it is absolutely a riot ! i honestly laugh at every other scene in this movie . mike myers does a fantastic job playing austin , dr . evil , and fat bastard . mini-me was a hilarious addition ! and scott evil and frau and number 2 are just as funny . and heather graham is pretty easy on the eyes too . i guess this movie is so cool because there are so many quotable quotes in it . . . two thumbs way up !
negative	ah , what a horrible ending to a great story .
positive	great movie , but an even greater sound track .
positive	if you loved the first one you'll love this one . i thought a sequel would suck but i was wrong , it was hilarious , i haven't laughed that much at a movie in a long time .
positive	i just saw this movie and i loved it . i watched the tape about four times in one weekend . i recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a genuinely good movie .
positive	this movie really puts its finger on the pulse of the drug scene . the cinematography is awesome . one of the best soundtracks to come out in years .
positive	a man is the lone survivor of a plane crash . he is then taken under the wing of a guy who recruits lucky people . his mentor informs him that he has a luck power , and he has the power to steal other people's luck . he takes him to underground gambling places where luck is needed . they take pictures so if someone loses , his luck is surrendered through the picture . they do things like run through a forest blindfolded , play russian roulette with five bullets , and run through traffic blindfolded . he loses his luck , and his girfriends , and tries to get them back . i am not doing this movie justice . it is a great movie .
positive	i love veggie tales . it's the best !
positive	almost scared me !
positive	bash those nazis
positive	no independent film had success like this film . i thought it was so well written , even if you don't like shakespeare . the writing created wonderful characters and i love how accurate they were in presenting the issue of women not being able to act then .
positive	the greatest golf movie next to happy gilmore
positive	for me , traffic is going to be my pick for the best film of not only the year , but the decade . stephen soderbergh took a large risk in making a film with a budget , with stars , and a relevant story line , and to agree with another film critic , it is the best drama hollywood has put out since the godfather in 1972 . the acting was superb , the photography ( which soderbergh shot under a pseudonym ) was brilliantly shaky and colorful , and the plot was so wonderfully complex without going over the top that it is too much to explain here and do it justice . benicio del toro and michael douglas are the real standouts in this picture , though nearly all other characters are just as complicated and lived in . soderbergh , even before traffic was released , was my favorite living director , and with this brilliant epic , he will surely become the same for others . for those who liked traffic , i also recommend soderbergh's cut and paste noir the limey which used many of the same techniques , and it also featured the always lovable luis guzman , who in traffic served with don cheadle as the comic relief , a witty live action puumba of their silly duo . i loved it , every frame .
positive	die hard was a good movie . the actors were good . they storyline was great , how he had to save the building .
negative	ahh puke ! we got rid of this stupid show in the 70's and now they brought it back . the only redeeming aspect is bill murray and even he cannot outway the lack of plot and stupidity of the idea . and drew barrymore , ohh , i am near vomitting , i'm not going to make it , bleechhh !
negative	how ed asner decided to do this movie , i'll never know . but , aside from that , it's stupid , disrespectful and of course , sick at times . avoid .
negative	this sucks . didn't the same guy that made that first biggie and tupac movie make this ? i thought it was amateur filmmaking . this investigating director should be working for 'celebrity justice' or some sh * t .
positive	i laughed out loud more often than in any movie i've seen in years . i plan to buy this one .
positive	this has to be the only disney cartoon where the heroine isn't a bimbo or close to one . it has a good plot , suspense , and music .
positive	i saw this straight , and still laughed !
positive	i loved this movie . alright , ya , it was freaky . kinda weirded me out at times . . . . but the plot was great ! it's a classic thriller ! the villan was definetly scarey . and we could feel for j-lo . i loved it , but if you are easily freaked out , its not for you !
positive	great claymation . all three of wallace and grommit are good . wallace is an inventor and grommit is the human-like dog . wallace rents a room to a penguin who turns out to be nasty . grommit catches on and saves the day . original storyline and even fun for adults to watch .
positive	wow , am i glad to see this movie so high on the publics list . i love this movie and every movie in the trilogy . i am also pleased to see that the dvd for all three movies is coming out in november . this is a great fictional movie that has the power to excite peopl of all ages . i reccomend this movie to everyone , everywhere of all ages . if you havent seen it see it . and if you have seen it watch it again .
positive	american pie was a brilliantly hilarious movie . it comedically portrays what we all went through in high school .
positive	i rate it tops for originality and for starting a genre ; although as usual , you can run a good thing into the ground !
positive	my favority comedy of the 80's , the golden years of comedy . i think the line there are two lines that say it all for me . the first from murray near the beginning of the movie when his girlfriend leaves him and the second from ramis when they are being interviewed by the army enlistment officer . one- " but who will water the plants ? " two - " no , we're not homosexual , but we are willing to try . "
positive	it hits the mark , it is right about everything , america wake up ! !
positive	thi is a great film . wooy , a toy cowboy was andy's favorite toy at first , then he gets buzz lightyear , a toy space ranger . and soon woody gets worried that he might be forgotten and tries to find a way to get rid of him . soon he ends up at sid's house . sid destroys toys . and soon woody and buzz become friends .
positive	this movie kept me on the edge of my seat , and it wasnt because there was something nasty on it . very suspenseful , it kept me guessing until the end . great for a cold rainy night with friends .
positive	help me with the bags ? you take the blond i'ill take the one in the turbin . a classic line from a great movie , gene wilder , mary feldman , terri garr , madeline kahn and peter boyle . all at the mercy of mel brooks . how could this not be funny .
positive	lovely movie talented jim henson and that nice looking david bowie . and my favrorite jenniffer connnelly . i can watch this movie over and over agan it so interesting .
positive	excellent sequel . . .
negative	fake !
negative	fake !
positive	i don't know why this film is so under rated by the viewers . maybe it's to complex . i find the twist absolutely stellar . and i don't perticularlly like tom cruise .
positive	mash the movie was very good . the tv show was pretty good , but i think the movie and its ability to display things they couldnt show on tv give it a much bigger punch . as a movie , mash is just one of those movies which will always be harmed , ratings-wise , by the political message it carried . i love the humor and the story of this movie and love to see it every time i can find it .
positive	i absolutely loved this movie and have seen it 3 times now because i want my friends to see it too and have watched it with them . it is not only very very funny , but also very intelligent , with astute observations about our culture and references to literature and classic film ( e . g . wizard of oz ) . basically a road movie set in the depression-era south . the performances by the three leads are outstanding . i have never been a fan of george clooney before , but i thought he did a hell of a good job in a smart and comic role as the know-it-all , scheming leader of the trio of escaped cons . kudos also to tim blake nelson as the sweet but dumb ( as a bag of hammers ) con , and john turturro as the gangly , angry con of the trio . the music is also wonderful , though i am a fan of bluegrass anyway . but it's not surprising to see this kind of music hit a popular chord - it's sweet , unslick , unaffected and touches our history . the coen brothers have done it again , but done it again in a different way . . . again .
positive	i loved this movie . diane lane and john cusack had very good chemistry . the story kept me interested and while there were serious moments , there were also a lot of light hearted moments . my favorite part as when she answered her father's personal add .
positive	this movie is the most scariest movie ever . it was innovative . the director really knew how to scare people . the dialogue was terrific , and so was the acting . the special effects were advanced for the time it was made . the dead person in the tub was fun .
negative	wit the hell is this film i've never heard of it
positive	one of the classic mob movies of all time . deniro is great , joe pesci explodes . also , it is chock full of classic quotes . seeing this makes most of the recent mob-theme movies look lame .
positive	this movie is amazing with the animals the animation and the music is all good and there is romance . with all the laughter you need to watch the movie over and over just to catch it all and especially with the comedy stand inns the hyenas it is a perfect hilarious film . it also has death and problems that actually happen . all up its perfect .
positive	this is my favorite movie of all time . i own the dvd and have watched it maybe 25 times . my family laughs and makes fun on me when i watch it . i ve never really been able to determine what draws me to it . i have noticed that there are no women characters in the movie other than incidental ( the opening scenes where his wife is shown , some of the jury , the last parole board has a representative , the board house woman and the grocery store ) , thus all the interaction of any substance is between men . this is not what i usually watch . somehow the isolation and introspection by the characters seems important . i usually have plot criticisms of movies such as when characters do things that are nonsensical , something requires 1000-to-one odds to work and works , or cars roll over and there is a small nuclear detonation to enhance a scene . but the plot in sr is flawless . i ll read some more of the reviews .
positive	iut is great
positive	tremendous ! this all tapping , ballet and jazz film is great and a must-see for all dance lovers . gene kelly , iam proud to say is the greatest dancer in the entire world , a cute one too and a great singer at that also . also starring debbie reynolds ( mother of princess leia or more appropriately carrie fischer ) is beautiful and amazing , considering she did not dance until this movie ( gene kelly taught her for the movie ) . it's a fun-loving , tap , crazy film with romance and humour ( especially from cosmo ) . go and c now !
positive	this movie was really great . changed the face of science fiction . it is easily the best star wars even though it was the first one and had inferior technology . . every single actor did their role very well . harrison ford was magnificent . . it was an epic
positive	the scariest film ever made
positive	i thought it was a fantastic movie . i could believe nicole kidman and ewan mcgregor had such beautiful voices !
negative	if you are going to tell one of histories greatest storys don't mess with it . achilies never sees the inside of troy as he is shot in the heal . it one of the the biggest parts of homer's story but hollywood comes along and change a major part . the effects were nice but the acting was not that great and neither was the script .
positive	i liked this movie because it showed american indians as wonderful people , not savages . it showed how the american settlers took advantage of the poor indians . kevin costner looked pretty hot in the movie .
negative	this movie , although many thought it was very funny , i felt it was stupid and ben stiller is incredibly annoying .
positive	this is one of my 2 favorite movies ; the other is babe , pig in the city . babe is probably better for children , but bv is virtually flawless as a cinematic experience . i liked it much more on the second viewing than the first ; there aren't many movies that i can say that about . mulholland drive is great also .
positive	one odd movie , but i like the part with the parting of the red soup !
positive	funny movie
positive	national lampoon movies are really great . this 1st movie about the griswald family vacation was so hilarious . . . not as good as mational lampoon's european vacation though .
positive	the princess bride is the best fairytale movie . the story within a story helps the action move along and adds a lot of the humor . the acting is wonderful and it leaves the audience with a great feeling . the music and scenery are perfect .
positive	hoosiers is a terrific basketball movie . gene hackman stars as a new high school coach with a mysterious past , and his approach to coaching raises the eyebrows of his players and the townspeople alike . hackman's character forges ahead , and eventually takes his team to the indiana state finals . the build-up to the finals was very effective , and i found myself totally involved in the outcome . after living in a small town in indiana for two years , i can attest to the fact that people really are that obsessed with basketball ! if you're looking for an absorbing , feel-good movie , try renting hoosiers . you won't be disappointed .
positive	this was another laugh your butt off comedy ! i guess maybe i am in love with comedy movies .
positive	the anthem of the 21st century techno-geek ( like me : ) ! great movie , terribly funny . i'm not a fan of english comedy but this is the shining exception .
positive	teppi hedren is an insufferable airhead . jessica tandy looks , well , overly paranoid . also stars a very young veronica cartwright , who gets some of the best lines in this offbeat movie . great visuals and sound design , with no score to speak of , although a children's song and timely editing is used to great effect . not overly scary , slow at first , but very fun to watch from the point that tippy tippi gets her head drilled by a seagull .
positive	i loved every part of the movie , especially the ending becuase it was so unsuspected . it covered a lot of topics that go on in everyday lives like drugs , sexuality , friends , relationships , jobs , etc . it really made me think about my life and how 'special' everything around me is .
positive	my favorite bruce willis movie . you gotta love the scene when he runs through the cut glass .
positive	the plot was very heartwarming and showed just how strong a father / son bond can be
negative	the plot was horrible and the special affects too unbelievable . the acting did not help much either , especially the males ( chou yung fat or such )
positive	all a man has in this world is his balls and his word , and i don't break'em for no one . you got that ? i don't even remember how many times i've quoted from this movie , since i saw it , about 10 years ago . pacino's performance is something else , it is not acting , it's simply art in it's most amazing form . definitely in my top 5 .
positive	a true classic , combining music , suspence , camera work and acting . memorable characters and wonderful performances . one of the best movies ever made , the first of the summer blockbusters .
negative	how did this get under the title horror movies ? blade was the biggest joke i've seen in a long time . i feel sorry for wesley snipes , that's going to take a long time to live down .
positive	ferris bueller is one of the best movies i have ever seen . it is a bona fide american classic . amazingly , that is the way all teenagers feel : how can i get out of going to school today ? it is indescribable how funny it is when ben stein playing the teacher is standing in front of the class repeating bueller , bueller , bueller , in his monotonous voice . another great part of the movie is when the principal thinks that ferris is calling the school and insults the person on the other line . ferris tries to mellow out his uptight friend , cameron . the bulk of the movie is his day off : seeing his father getting into a taxi , going to the cubs game , singing twist and shout with the voice of john lennon in the middle of a parade float , hurrying home in time so that no one would find out he was feigning illness . when the principal rings the doorbell and it has that recording , you go nuts laughing . a really wonderful movie .
positive	how much more can a man value his word ?
positive	much better than i expected . excellent ! the story , casting , and cinemaphotography were all great . this will definitely go down in history as one of john singleton's greatest movies .
positive	definitely one of the best comedies ever . jack lemmon and tony curtis are very impressive , and marilyn monroe , for once , does a good job . i would definitely recommend it .
negative	no matter how many scream movies will be made , they will all be horrible . every 'unexpected' spook and fright can be seen a mile away . when someone is walking through the dark and the camera is on close-up , of course the chick will turn around to find someone there . don't go to get scared . you should take your girl , so she can hold on to you .
positive	the first and , i think , the best of the tricolors trilogy by polish writer / director krzysztof kieslowski . the most emotional of the three , with a tremendous score . juliet binoche is haunting and beautiful as ever ; her reserve and somewhat cold beauty suit kieslowski's themes of pain and liberty very well .
positive	this was an amazing movie . the impossible now seems possible because this movie shows a retarded man able to make it . this shows that we are all able to make it and that nothing's ever too late or too bad . it's a movie that definitely gives hope .
positive	i thought rice a roni was the san francisco treat . . . . . . . . it was , but they want to change their image
positive	depalma's best . . . remember the shower scene with angie dickenson ?
positive	these movies are nothing less than amazing . i can't explain humor that profound . don't rent them though , just flip to one of those t stations ( ex : tnt ) on a sunday afternoon .
negative	i dislike this movie alot
positive	who ever chose terrible are fuc # $ # $ stupid
positive	love it . the best movie i have ever seen . it has the best plot and scenes that i never forget .
positive	one of the best james bond movies ! ! a must for bond lovers : )
positive	great ! love it !
positive	so chill . i don't know if i was just in the right mood at the right time or what it was but i was one of the few people in the theatre who really enjoyed it . the soundtrack is excellent , the plot is . . . well , rather simple , and though it is not consistently laugh-out loud hilarious , the humor is very dry , very wry and very funny . a wistful modern masterpiece .
negative	it seems this is the movie that started the trend of using gore as a cheap way to create shock . the horror genre has never been the same since . thanks .
positive	excellent film . sure there are some inaccuracies in it but who cares it's entertainment and excellent entertainment at that . very engaging , it really draws you in , f . murray abraham is absolutely transfixing in this film . he does an incredible job as the aged saliery . his expressions , mannerisms , and speech is spot on . if you've missed this then you've really missed out .
positive	i love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
positive	the movie was great who cannot love macauley ? lets just say he's a pretty cool guy , believe me , take it from someone who knows him well .
positive	one of my all time favourite action / comedy films . there were good one-liners and hilarious characters . not one character stole the show . neat camera work and soundtrack .
positive	i think this was the first movie i saw of nicole and she played the part very well i loved the movie and was stunned at the end .
negative	a bunch of cheerleaders get massacred . who the f * * k pays money to watch this s * * t ?
positive	brilliant movie . it shows what a discipline can do . we need more coach's like coach carter in our high schools and colleges . a few in the workplace would not be a bad idea either ! !
negative	terrible , horrible , disgusting . it's a pity to see how the money is spent on this way .
negative	i hate these mocumentaries because of the camera style ( shaky , not steady ) and the acting ( full of stuttering , pauses , monotone speech ) . this is no exception .
positive	if i could pick more stars then i would . what i dont understand is how a movie like stigmata could be compared to a movie like night of the living dead , great plot , decent acting , amazing . the effects are really the only thing that people seem to complain about but what do you expect from a low budget movie . . .
positive	you won't come to any introspective revelations because of this film , but it is a rollercoaster of surprising action . you really get drawn into the plight of this much wronged mother and run with her on this race to ultimate revenge . ashley judd is beautiful and convincing .
positive	great movie . eddie murphy and other daddy's were hilarious !
positive	this movie would have long been forgotten if it wasn't for bruce lee . his screen presence , power and stunning physique make this movie worth watching . . and williams massive fro . there is no way roper could beat bolo ! things to wtach out for : 1 . hans terribly dubbed voice 2 . williams impressive fro . 3 . the " art of fighting without fighting " scene . 4 . " bull * * * mr . han-man ! " 5 . jackie chan getting his neck snapped by the master in the underground lair scene . 6 . " the battle with the guards was extra-ordinary ! " 7 . bruce lee delivering a massive kick to han's head .
positive	a classic film that was revolutionary . this film , although older than me , scared me to death and i was amazed art how good this film was .
negative	i can't believe people actually liked this god awful movie . a real lawyer wouldn't let some piece of trailer trash that dresses like she's a friggin' prostitute yell profanity in their face . but i guess if you flash some cleavage you can get whatever your tiny heart desires .
positive	the greatest sci-fi movie ever made . a classic shakespearian story to a futurisic theme . it is the 23rd century . khan noonian sihn , a geneticly engineered dictator from 1996 seeks revenge against a starfleet captain and a universe that betrayed him 15 years ago . with a weapon of unbelievable power , the genesis device , the crew of a starship , and a hiding science team at stake , including kirk's alienated son , kirk must overcome all odds , and defeat an arch nemesis he thought he had left behind . riccardo montalban was great , no one else could have played the part . leonard nimoy was also great , when spock died , it touched every star trek fan . everyone must see this great movie .
positive	surprisingly entertaing little movie . based very loosly on the homerian epic the oddessy this movie has some very funny moments . it has rewatchablity . the soundtrack is a nice change from the ordinary .
positive	this is my favorite musical , and i don't really like musicals . robert preston and shirley jones were both great in this movie . a very young ronnie howard was also in the movie . in my opinion , a classic !
positive	it's a great movie about being a working mom . the portrayal of this sharp tongued character who is quick to take offense , but still manages to enlist people in her cause was incredibly effective . i could have done with less of the bra straps showing all the time .
positive	the best french movie of 2000 , it is a pleasure to see such a good movie , with such an excellent cast . jean-pierre bacri is terrific and i would advise you to see the movie in french , if i dare to say , because there's a wonderful scene in which he speaks so well english it could scare you to death about french people . . . enjoy that movie , it is typically french !
positive	this is one that i can watch over and over again . it's cool , hilarious , and excellent . a true kick ass movie ! ! ! here's to waynes world : schwing !
positive	okay , i like comic books , even though i haven't collected for a while . i like the language they speak , the cues they leave . this movie is written in their language , and if you speak it , certain things are obvious from the beginning . that's important because the movie divides its audience into two parts ; those who can see all too clearly what's going on , and those who treat this like a normal movie . the weird thing is , this is a drama , it is reality , but the two or three primary causes for everything that happens are strictly comic book fare . what happens to the villain is a staple of every great batman comic ; he gets carted off in the end to an asylum for the criminally insane . the evil that the hero discovers is right out of some news magazine nightmare about a serial killer , but the hero handles it by dashing into the situation in a cloak and astoundingly saving the day . yet while that's going on , you have the quiet , careful , meticulous direction of m . night shamaylan that we remember from the sixth sense , dividing up the moments into oppresive and gripping tick tocks of a clock . his direction was better suited to this movie ; in fact i think the sixth sense was overrated . not everybody understands where he's coming from , and with a story like this , that's even further out there than tss was , you see it in audience reaction . nonetheless , if you've ever appreciated the dark cheesiness of a master villain like vincent price's abominable dr . phibes you'll see the important contribution to this film , and all film , that samuel l . jackson makes . picture the kid in the wheelchair from malcolm in the middle without the years of healthy social interaction , and his finger on the pulse of a phenomenon too real to seem anything but crazy , and driven to act out to crazy extremes as a result of it . introverts like this guy exist , you see them playing magic the gathering in bookstores , and though the movie is written in comic book language , the compelling dementia of the villain is still altogether there . what can i tell you ; if what i'm saying makes any sense to you , you'll totally enjoy this movie . i was blown away . if you're not keyed into this dark side of fandom , you may need something a little more compromising . m . night has all my respect for taking a chance with this story , and in my opnion , succeeding . weird and good .
positive	tarantino's direction makes this movie chronologically confusing . it does however , not lack for action and good acting . dropping you right into the story . like pulp fiction , has many memorable scenes .
positive	great movie . very , very solid throughout , with good action sequences , acting , etc . how in the hell can this be rated worse than die another day and face / off ? ! ?
positive	can i stretch the word excellent ? yes , i can . great performances , excellent screenplay . ed harris is amazing .
positive	this was one of the most thought-provoking movies i have ever seen . the anette benning character really made me take a look at myself , and what can you say about kevin spacey-the man is the best actor of our generation .
positive	i am a big sci-fi lover so alien immediately drew me in . with an awesome cast and a very memorable main character ( the alien that is ) this movie a veritable thrill ride . the action seldom takes a stop as ripley , the main human character , is forced to save herself , her crew , and her cat . the wonderfully done alien in the movie is undoubtedly the most notable feature in this picture , as it tries to kill off each of the crewmembers . the thing i probable like the most about this movie is what i like about most movies like jaws and predator . that would be the fact that you dont see much of the monster till near the end . to me , constantly seeing the thing your running from just makes the sense of wonder leave the movie entirely . i have always loved the alien saga , and the fist of the bunch is most defiantly a great one . i highly recommend this movie to all sci-fi lovers .
positive	i love jim carrey and i love this movie ! i watch this movie just to get a good laugh . how can you hate this movie ? it's halirious !
positive	if you liked apollo 13 , you'll love the right stuff . the movie runs a little long , but supplies an almost complete look at the mercury program . ed harris and scott glenn are excellent . dennis quaid and fred ward provide perfect support to create a cast of well played charcters . this history is interesting enough by itself that embelishment is unnecessary . jeff goldbloom bothers me though .
negative	a dumb-ass movie , appealing to dumb-asses . about as funny as a rubber crutch .
positive	spaceballs is one of the funniest mel brooks movies out there . it is a personal favorite of mine and it's just as funny ever time i see it . i highly suggest this movie .
negative	a nasty film by a director whose stock in trade is over the top unpleasantness e . g . the fury . de palma has to be one of the worst film makers of all time , right down there with tarantino and david lynch . if you want to see how gangster films should be done stick with coppola and scorsese .
negative	visually stunning , but poorly written and horribly acted . keanu and winona were miscast . they can't do the accents !
positive	after finally sitting down to watch this i could picture classictvfan pacing back and forth in his mom's basement while shouting the word inconceivable . here's a quick impression for you . you mean there are people on the surface that don't like star trek ? well , that's just so wrong it's . . . inconceivable ! !
positive	i was as impressed with this movie as i was hoping to be . we don't have enough movies with substance anymore , it's all about who can swear the most , or get the most loving , or blow up the most . this was a film that i have no trouble letting the kids watch .
positive	one of the best cartoons ever made .
positive	batman was just one of your typical superhero movies that you can enjoy . i thought that tim burton did a good job on emphasizing the darkness of batman's character .
positive	it has judy and the land of oz .
positive	i love ritchie valens and lou diamond phillips did a great job playing him .
positive	hilary swank's performance as brandon teena was phenomenal . there is an oscar award is this young woman's future ! !
positive	classic sketches . humor that can often be pretty crude , but cleverly ironic . the way the boarding school boys act utterly disinterested during the ott sex education scene is priceless ! lots of clever parodies concerning the nuances of english and american culture as well .
positive	great movie , great performance by fontaine , great photography , great mood music and an all-around great cast . the only hitchcock film to win best picture .
positive	this is probably one of the most legendary low budget movies . as opposed to the blair witch project , in the case of this film not only the actors are hysterical , but also the viewers get their share of madness . the special effects and filming techniques that were used in a sometimes quite experimental manner were an absolute novelty at the time and add to the involvement of the audiences into this extremely scary and bloody movie .
positive	one of the top five westerns of all-time . a very entertaining movie that did not rely on the duke to carry it . a fantastic supporting cast that was the main reason why this is such a great film in addition to geat directing and writing .
negative	i used to be able to say i know what you did last summer was the worst horror movie ever . at least it tried to develope characters , tried to be interesting , tried to be original . this film misses every beat and fails at even being a movie worth pissing on . if anything i laughed myself silly whenever dracula himself showed up . he reminded me of neo from the matric . does every actor have to over and under act ? there is no middle ground acting wise in this film . this movie only succeeding in taking my money . now i am a messanger . if you have a taste for unintintionaly funny movies go for it . if you want a good hunk of horror , go rent the shinning .
positive	this movie would have been even better with more gordon gecko and less charlie sheen .
positive	one of america's classic film offerings . this film is delightful . you need to watch this film because : 1 ) it is a classic . 2 ) hollywood , et . al . do not make films like this anymore . 3 ) one of the greatest actors , gregory peck , stars in this film . 4 ) who could forget a kid named scout ? 5 ) learn a little about the racist south and how contact with blacks created controversy .
positive	i thought this was such a good movie ! it made you want to get up and dance . it was very inspirational and gave me confidence as a dancer ! ! !
negative	i liked this movie better when it was released under its original title mogwai droppings
negative	i think i'm still suffering insulin shock from this sacchrine nonsense .
positive	i love this movie as cheesy as it is , john cusack is the best .
positive	i don't know what some of these reviewers are complaining about . i consider myself a discerning movie watcher , and must say that titan a . e . is nearly as epic a space opera as star wars itself . seriously ! this movie has it all--amazing visuals , great story and voice talents , and an awesome soundtrack to boot !
positive	callmetootie is an idiot . . . . bill murray is hilarious and groundhog day is a classic . i want some flajacks . too late for breakfast officer ?
positive	this is the best movie of the year and possibly in recent years . the film touches on many subjects without being preachy , leaving the viewers with room for interpretations and thoughts which i think is clever . the music score and cinematography are perfect . i indeed prefer the movie than the book which can actually be preachy and full of prpogandas . for those who are offended by the abortion and incest themes , give me a break . what is the morality portrayed in american beauty ( guns , infidelity and rape of the underaged girl ! ) ? why people rarely condemn the themes in pulp fiction ( totally rubbish film which makes swearing sound cool and violence a norm ) ? i think many americans are rather bored by such heart warming films like the cider house rules but cherish the violence and perverty in the aforementioned films . no wonder america has so many gunshot cases because people are so used to violence that guns are still not banned !
positive	a 5 , just for james cagney on the speaker , who did it , who did it . . . .
positive	this was a realistic movie about the hood ! i used to live in the hood and it brought back memories .
positive	it was really sad and it was kinda messed up too , but it was a great movie
positive	titanic has everything beautiful protagonists , exciting story , wonderful special effects , and it makes you laugh and cry ! this is no surprise considering it's directed by the master steven spielberg .
positive	more realistic than most people want to admit . the green party seizes power in germant and kicks out the us army . a revolution in mexico . this leads to a soviet led invasion of the united states . the soviets would not nuke the usa because they desperatly need our fertile farm-land . the usa won't nuke it's own people . a two pronged invasion with troops coming up through mexico and down though canada brings a conventional war to mainland america . a ragtag group of young kids in small town , heartland usa see their idyllic little world turned upsidedown by the invasion , they decide to kick some commie butt . this is the plot behind this strangly compelling , and moving , movie . while it does not feature the best acting , and is a litle over the top in its patriotism , it is still fun to watch . unlike other war movies , where the good guys come in and save the day , the outcome and final resolution is , in a mild sort of way , unexpected . one of patrick swayze's first movies . the group of young freedom fighters are , of course , a disparate group . you have the jocks , the nerds , the smart ones , and the chicks . sort of like the breakfast club on steroids . a fairly passable war flick . ignatious j . reilly says check it out .
positive	the graduate is a 1967 classic comedy-drama that you have to see to belive . the film is about a young man who gets seduced by his girlfriend's mother , mrs . robinson . as the film goes along , their relationship is quite strange and small , as he still dates her daughter .
positive	definately a classic horror movie ! i remember falling totally in love with johnny depp after seeing him in this flick . 1 , 2 , freddy's coming for you . . . . . 3 , 4 better lock the door . . . . . . 5 , 6 get a crucifix . . . . 7 , 8 better stay up late . . . . . 9 , 10 . . . never sleep again !
positive	i give it two thumbs up . jodie foster was great as always
positive	this film is kurosawa's masterpiece . it's even better than his 1985 movie , " ran . "
positive	great movie .
positive	great movie .
positive	this is my all time favorite movie . it is about priorities and what really matters in life . it may seem to start off a little slow , but all of the things at the beginning are leading up to something worthwhile . it is the movie that made james stewart my favorite actor and frank capra my favorite director . it is warm , funny and has a good moral . a true classic and the closest thing to a perfect movie there is .
positive	james cagney really shows his acting chops in this movie about george m cohan . an entertaining musical and cagney really puts his all into it . he's touching , delightful and electryfing . walter huston is great as his father jerry . cagney won an academy award for his performance . the movie will not disappoint .
negative	i hated the f * * * ing thing ! it was so darn scary ! it got me so jumpy that it wasn't even funny ! the ending was the worst i have seen in years . what is it with modern horror movies and bad endings ? first jeepers creepers and now this ! why did they have to kill the guy ? he was the only cool guy in the movie . that's totally not how i would end a movie . and i just wanna say that the part of the reason why the movie scared me so f * * * ing much is that it was so nasty ! i mean the dead bodies didn't have to be so ugly . . . and bigbaby is right , too many unanswered questions . i think the horrors should be scary while you watch them and the ending is supposed to rid the viewer of all fear , because everything is supposed to be explained . my butt ! and considering that the movie was actually a rip-off of that other japanese movie , its identical copy one might say , the director has done a poor job . message to the directors : please , don't make so f * * * ing scary senseless movies !
negative	i had hoped to like this movie , but if just had a boring storyline in my opinion . reese did a good job with what she had to work with , but i'd never recommend this film .
positive	easily the best of the star wars trilogy . the beginning battle was awesome , yoda , darth vadar . the battles were all perfect . it had an open ending and a poweful battle which kicked ass . the dialogue was much improved from the first too .
negative	do movies reflect the personalities of people who make them ? if so , michael bay ( director ) and jerry bruckheimer ( producer ) must have no personalities at all . the characters are only self interested and shallow while the actual bombing of pearl harbor seemed like it's only purpose was to mess up that little love triangle between the only three characters in the movie . what a bunch of saps .
positive	paul schofield won the oscar for his portrayal of thomas more , a man of integrity , faith and courage in facing henry viii . ( you know all about good king hank , don't you ? )
positive	i agree completely with leis -- one of the best ever music movies . the music is good , and the story is heartwarming . the christmas season just isn't the same for me if i don't manage to catch this movie ! the actor who plays the general , can't remember his name , is wonderful and the scene at the end with the reunion of many of his men makes me cry every time !
negative	did not like this movie at all . it's a waste of time .
negative	so very , very fake .
positive	this show is great ! remember when the nose got flattened ?
positive	mel gibson , what can i say ? it is definitely one of the best summer movies with a great plot , acting , and smooth transitions between scenes . the only complaint i had about this movie is that it is too much like braveheart .
positive	honestly how can you not love the muppets ?
negative	just an action movie to showcase the onscreen partnership of ice cube and mike epps . not very good at all .
negative	terrible ! halle berry what were you thinking ? the storyline is stupid , the acting is boring , and the plot never takes off . no chemistry at all between benjamin bratt and halle berry , oh and that terrible catwoman suit and boots . the movie should be in the comedy category , instead of action movie . the critics were right on the money this time .
positive	this was one of the best movies i have ever seen ( and that is saying something ) ! it really got to the depth of the reality for some people without any sugarcoating . angelina jolie was incredible and fascinating to watch as a seemingly coldhearted sociopath . i have to admit i kinda could relate to a few situations in this movie and it really brought up a lot of questions in my mind .
positive	awesome movie dreamworks di da great job of making a movie that kids and adults would enjoy . great ending too .
positive	awwwww the gremlin is so cute awwwwww awwwww i just want to hug u and squeeze u i love u gremlin i love u u love me where a happy family with a great big hug and a kiss from me to u wont u say ull hug me too awwwww kiss kisss
negative	no go
positive	more of an action film than sci-fi , but still fun to watch ! update : there is a dvd ( both special edition and regular ) out there , just thought that pbeavr would like to know , hope that it helps !
positive	alot better than u . s . marshalls
negative	i don't even want to see this mean , terrorizing piece of crap , it's about making fun of christians . and i'm a christian .
positive	it was a better movie than i thought it would be . it is a chick and dude movie because of the girls and the sentiment .
positive	simply fabulous ! loved it ! haley joel osment shows once more the amazing actor that he is - and hopefully will keep getting better ! the cast - including teddy - is very well chosen . the story is magical and steven spielberg is at his best , doing what he does best - telling stories .
positive	swingers is one of my favorite movies of all time . in college , this was our drinking movies . i agree with the other viewers who say this is a movie males would like . i've seen it with a few girls , and only one like it , but with my friends , we've seen it at least ten times and laugh at the same part all the time . it isn't a movie that is a laugh minute , but its one where you can relate . also , you will have the vocabulary in your head for weeks .
positive	sanctuary ! sanctuary ! good final comment by medgar evers below .
positive	this movie is a guilty pleasure of mine . saw it first when i was about 12 years old and have never forgotten it . it does have some pretty campy dialogue and scenes , but at the same time it is gripping in a way that's not easy to forget . the characters are also memorable . i have seen this movie gain more notoriety recently and sense that it is becoming a cult classic . something about the period and its status as the vanguard of disaster movies , plus those great shelley winters underwater scenes , i can see why . climb aboard !
positive	i really did enjoy it , and i can relate to it , which makes it even better . fun performances , and knock-out dance scenes .
positive	best disney movie ever . incredible animation and the story has real heart . the songs are some of the best ever heard in a disney movie .
positive	gotta love that one . yes , they are one of my favourite characters . this movie along with the other two that aardman productions had done are the best claymation i've ever seen ; their countless hours on making this movie have shown why they are an award winning production . any person at any age would appreciate this movie . we shall see if on oct . 7 , the curse of the wererabbit will live up to the hype of the original three w & g movies and chicken run .
positive	i like it . this is different .
positive	very finely crafted movie , with not a weak performance to be seen . caan is perfect as sonny , and pacino has his breakout performance as michael . this , with the sequel are possibly the best pair of movies ever made . the third one , however , is just mundane .
negative	this movie was stupid .
positive	i watched this movie expecting to be bored out of my mind , but to my surprise , i could not stop laughing ! my preconception of the movie was that i wouldn't enjoy watching it because it centers around golf ( i am not a golf fan ) , but i found it to be one of the most hilarious movies i have ever seen . . . you don't have to be a golf know-it-all to like it . my favorite scene is the fist fight between bob barker and happy . . . it is one the funniest scenes in comedy-movie history ; it's definitely a classic . anyways , a real funny movie starring a real funny guy . . . fun to watch over and over again for some laughs !
negative	i hate jason movies . way too sick . who wants to see an idiot killing teenagers ?
negative	i'd have been happier if they stayed away from my home .
positive	i give planet of the apes ( 2001 ) five stars , it is one of the best sci-fiction films ( next to star wars ) . it 's my favorite movie so far . the end of the movie may not make sense to some people , but it is still a good film and worth watching . my favorite part in the movie , is where general thade ( tim roth ) looks right at leo davidson ( mark wahlberg ) and said this one looked at me . . i loved that part . planet of the apes ( 2001 ) rulez ! ! !
negative	frankly my dear i do not give a damn about this movie .
positive	a masterpiece , an utterly beautiful film , all the more amazing because it was filmed in paris during the occupation . a hundred , nay a thousand times better than the disney atrocity .
positive	this was a great love story . i actually thought it would be boring , but the relationship jack and rose had was beautiful . never a boring scene in the movie , and will keep you wanting to watch it over and over again to feel what the titanic victims felt .
negative	my friends said this was the funniest movie ever . i watched it and had no clue what they were talking about . it had an extremley dissapointing ending , such bad humor , and some bad acting by good actors .
positive	this movie to me earned every point it got from me . it's funny and every actor in this film played their part very well . overall , the film should have the rating of 9 or 10 . you would agree if you saw the movie ( i see dead people ) .
positive	those who see this movie as just another good versus evil movie are missing the point . this movie is about doing your duty and acting with integrity versus acting out of cowardly self interest . an entire town turns it's back on will kain , including his deputy , in his hour of need . even his new wife is ready to abandon him because she won't try to understand why he feels he must stay to face frank miller , who has vowed to kill him . even the one person who understands him , helen ramirez , turns away . the only people ready to stand with him are a drunk and a boy . gary cooper acts the part of will kain wonderfully . you can feel his quiet desperation and his self doubt , as he realizes that he will have to fight this fight alone against four men . when kain finally realizes he will be alone , he sits in his office to write his will . what follows is simply one finest montages anywhere in cinema . as the clock ticks toward high noon and the music builds , we see the faces of all the people who have abandoned him . the tension builds and builds until it is broken by the whistle of the noon train . the result of the fight is a foregone conclusion , but that doesn't matter . by the time the gunfight begins the story is essentially over , except when his new wife , an avowed pacifist , kills one of the bad guys rather than see her husband killed . the last scene is perfect , where kain looks at the crowd gathered after the gunfight , and tosses his marshal's star on the ground in contempt , and rides away silently . high noon is simply the best western ever made , including the searchers and unforgiven ( sorry clint ) .
positive	some people may not agree with me for this rating , but i liked the movie very much . as soon as i saw the final battle between neo and smith it blew my mind . than i liked the battle for zion , i liked the first part where they go to save neo and as soon as they enter the bar a fight breaks out . i like that one . i liked that movie very much
positive	great acting . haunting story and the comedy made it more so . william h . macy was great ! the coen brothers got me . i believed for the longest time that this was a somewhat true story . but now i hear it wasn't . it's a new low to introduce a film as a true story and then have that be just a joke .
positive	erika christensen does a real convinving job in this movie like classictvfan and rodeodo say . she is a wonderful actress who could make playing a tossed salad interesting .
positive	never read the books but i'm in love with this movie series .
positive	based on victor hugo's novel , this one definitely goes down as a classic . the make-up work on quasimodo's face is so well done- haunting to look at today , imagine what it looked like to people 80 years ago ! the scenes of quasimodo's torture are so dramatic , and most of the acting is excellent . not everyone knows , however , that the real story ends with an image of quasimodo and esmerelda's decaying skeletons holding each other . . .
positive	forgive me , but i adore this movie . i rented it really for lack of anything else that i really wanted to see , plus i thought it looked kinda funny . it turned out to be surprisingly adorable . alright , fine , very unbelievable , but so what ? it's a movie , not a documentary . and i thought it did a fantastic job of portraying high school life as it really is , which many movies miss the mark on . i would consider this a chick flick , with porn stars . it really is a teenage love story , and yeah , pretty much a carbon copy of risky business , but in a heavy time of remakes , if there is going to be one , it might as well be a good one , and this is .
positive	princes purple rain was the last album that i loved after that they were ok but the movie saw it in the theatre saw the purple rain tour in 85
positive	this is my favorite movie of all time . i've read the book too ( called wise guys ) , the book and movie are equally superb . robert deniro portrays jimmy the gent beautifully ( of course , would you expect any less from deniro ? ) . he has a certain charisma that will never be possessed by any other actor . . . it's undescribable . ray liotta did an excellent job of portraying henry hill . . i love his cool and calm demeanor through out the movie ( except when he goes into panic mode toward the end ) . another great , joe pesci . goodfellas is his best performance . any guy that can portray a member of the mobb and then go on to play a crook in a kids movie ( home alone ) deserves credit . my favorite part of the movie ? the scene with billy batts . moral : don't bang on the trunk . most tantalizing movie ever ! definatley a classic !
positive	mel gipson : great actor + great director = awesome movie
positive	the greatest ( no not exaggerated ) greatest musical ever ! ( tied with mary poppins ) anyone who says julie andrews is not appealing is just jealous of her fantastic talent . she is the best female vocalist ever to live ! and this movie proves it . best musical best family film guarenteed to delight the entire family from the little ones to the elderly . go out and get this movie you wont be sorry
positive	a bit twisted compared to the comics , but who wouldn't love superhero stories ?
positive	great movie based on a great book . unfortunatly like with almost all other movies based on books , there just isn't enough time to fit in all the specifics . in actuality dantes goes to much greater lengths to obtain his revenge . however , the director did a good job of not making the movie too long which could risk losing the interest of those who weren't familiar with the story .
positive	i loved this movie ! it showed that being popular isn't a must . its cute and a lot like the world today
positive	alright , i'll admit it . i'm a star wars geek , although granted i don't have a room in my house dedicated to it and i didn't sleep on the sidewalk to get tickets to the latest three travesties . that being said , i do love star wars . despite mediocre acting and special effects that are now considered laughable , i find myself still enjoying it . its uncomparable to other sci-fi flicks because it started the genre and is still the hallmark of the genre . its fun , entertaining and has made george lucas a ridiculously wealthy man .
positive	one of my personal favorites once i could understand the plot . i love the movie because it was original and sexy . tom cruise did a fabulous job at holding the audience in suspense . i own the soundtrack .
positive	the movie was stellar . agree with the other respondent , it was humphrey bogart's best of many great portrayals . he perfectly conveyed the paranoia , obsessive compulsive behavior , and veiled cowardice of lcdr phillip queeg . incredible casting with van johnson ( later became the green hornet ) , fred mcmurry ( playing a heel ) , and jose ferrer . the book ( written by herman wouk ) is even better . no story captures the responsibility and accountability of a military officer at war better than caine mutiny . read the book , rent the video .
positive	coyote ugly was a wonderful movie , i think it really gives you inspiration . no matter how many times you watch it , it always bring a smile to my face .
positive	this movie should and will leave you sobbing . it takes you on an emotional roller coaster , from sublime to heartbreak . the tragedy is that the movie is true , and it's so sad when you realize people can be so cruel . ( more conservative people might not enjoy this flick , but i suggest they see it anyway . it might open their eyes . )
positive	people that rates this bellow 5 is retarded they should all be shot and pissed on
positive	i loved this movie . brad pitt and robert redford are excellent in it . it is most definitely worth going to see at the movies and i am going to buy it the day it hits the shelves .
positive	superb ! ! that's the only word i can say to describe this movie . have seen it 2 times . willem defoe , what can i say , the man is not only gorgeous , but he can act too ! ! the scene where he runs out to the chopper barely alive , excellent ! !
positive	good music , great photography , marlon brando and karl malden at their best , talking about traitors a subject very fragil but very good for a man like kazan that lived persecutions , the best film of elia kazan
positive	this is among the most underrated comedies of all time . this was a lol riot all the way through . when they're not too busy partying off camera , norm macdonald and ardie lange can be comedic geniuses ( snl , madtv , howard stern show ) . once you get to the bar scene , the laughter never ends .
positive	still my favorite imax movie , after all these years . no 3d glasses , no special effects--a simple movie about the joys of air travel . it was my first imax movie so it holds a special place in my heart .
positive	holy craparoonie ! ! ! why is this animated slice of nirvana this far back ? granted , it came out awhile ago , but stick it on a plasma screen and watch it dazzle your retinas ! ! old-school showcase for meticulous paintwork that still can't be done on computer to any satisfying length . what it suffers in cultural curiosities is more than made up for in sheer scope and chutzpah . count me an avowed fan .
positive	this is the science fiction movie . despite it's revolutionary movie making technology , it's classic good vs . evil plot makes for good family entertainment . this space age western should be the measuring pole for all science fiction movies .
positive	now this is more like it . finally a superhero movie that actually resembles the comic books . god i loved this movie . i have to tell everybody out there that this is already one of my all-time favorite movies . if spider-man is your favorite superhero please god you have to see this one .
positive	i thought it was a superb version of a excellent graphic novel .
positive	spanish conquistadors , driven on by the obsessive klaus kinski , search for the fabled lost city of gold , eldorado - through hallucinatory peruvian landscapes of mist-enveloped mountains , dense rainforest , exotic wildlife and the mighty , challenging amazon . a mesmerising adventure and unforgettable journey for the armchair spectator !
positive	despite its average acting , it's still a wonderful fairy tale for a generation of people who grew up without fairy tales . had a big impact on my childhood . empire strikes back was my first novel at 9 . . .
positive	this movie was more interesting then funny . it had a very interesting story . i especially enjoyed watching it when i was younger because that is a desire that is common in younger children , especially boys - to become big . big had a touching story line .
positive	i was so into the movie that when it ended i wanted to have a sword fight and leap across rooftops .
positive	this is the best monty python movie of them all .
positive	that movie is like so funky . . even tho it wasnt scary i still liked it ! ! ! rock on ! ! ' !
positive	saving private ryan was a good drama . i loved the way it made me feel like i was right in the trenches with them . the actors did a good job of making me feel their emotions . i think i really know what war was like because of that movie . this was one of the best movies i have seen . this was a very touching , very realistic movie . the reason i like it so much is because it is so realistic .
positive	i believe the shawshank redemption is the best movie ever created . the movie was directed extremely well , it has excellent cast , and above all , it has brilliant and wonderful story . it is funny , sensitizes , sophisticated and has an astonishing end - every thing a movie should have . when i first saw this movie , i was very impressed , especially from its end . from that time , i manage to see it at least ten times and each time i saw it again , i enjoy it like i haven t seen it at all ; i even see things that i haven t noticed before . i think that everyone should see this movie at least one time , and if you haven t seen it yet , go see it - i promise you that you ll enjoy every second of it .
positive	awesome movie ! ! one of the best i have seen .
negative	just two words : not funny
positive	a classic and trippy film . whether watched along with dark side of the moon or not , this movie rules every time . the flying monkees scene will always send chills down your spine , no matter how many times you have seen it .
positive	great movie to be in the same league as 'ben hur' . . . . . . . . .
positive	the newest miyazaki hayao's animation . it's a fantasy story and its good for kids .
positive	incredible , but am trying to find out if it is available to buy
positive	i thought this film did an excellent job of connecting the viewer with the actors . it left me emotional . it kept me involved . i wanted to really meet the characters and help fix them .
positive	zoiks . . . .
positive	fever was a such a cultural phenomenon and it technically wasn't a musical . there are so many memorable scenes and it is really a great story of young , urban america in the late 1970's . and of the course , the bee gees music is amazing .
positive	he's not the messiah , he's a very naughty boy
positive	i'm not sure how i lasted so long without seeing this movie , but it just turned out that way . after hearing friends of mine rave about it , quote from it ( did you get the digits ? ) , and compare themselves to characters in the movie , i was kind of expecting the worst . swingers is in fact an amazing movie - and oddly touching . it's a guys' movie through and through , and does a very believable job of portraying how single guys act and act towards each other - without falling into the trap of beer commercial stereotypes . definitely a movie to rent for your buddy who is coming off of a rough break up . five stars .
positive	this movie is a visual masterpiece . the time and effort it took to make this film far surpasses the over hyped computer trash put on by dreamworks or disney . this movie has true artistic skill and a great script to add ! i recommend this movie to anyone .
negative	okay , now this kind of film , even for kids , is a real insult to filmgoers everywhere . in spite of all its dynamic advertising and cool posters , it turned out to be nothing all that special , just a series of grotesque animal fights with dodgy cgi and tacky weapons . the fact that it tried to preach the theory that all cats are evil and that it's only thanks to the companionship of dogs that we're all happy and free didn't do it any favours . i like cats myself , and actually found it alarmingly offensive , particularly the portrayal of all 'cat people' as fat , drippy women and the horrific 'educational' cartoon of ancient egyptian history in which everything gets disgustingly distorted . but it couldn't even make the best of such a dubious concept . the script was poor and disappointingly slow-paced , with jokes i'd heard a thousand times before , the puppetry , particularly for the chinese hairless , was pathetic , the plot was tissue-thin , and acting , both people and voices , was really , really bad . only the trained cats and dogs gave it any life and soul . little attempt was actually made to develop the characters , even the animal ones ( the least said about those irritating 'humans' the better ) . the plot ? a puppy with an adult voice is accidentally called upon to protect a scientist working on a cure for dog allergies from cats trying to take over the world . very , very tedious . your kids deserve better than this . if you're a dog lover , you'd probably be better off giving this a miss . if you're a cat lover , avoid it like hell !
positive	love this movie . it's a great love story , and a good family movie .
negative	sucked . it is difficult to get over the fact that richard is 48 and winona is 22 . additionally , ricahard dated winona's mom . how are we supposed to swallow that !
positive	this movie is one of the best i've ever seen and i could watch it many times . kathy bates stars at an ordinary housewife , whose life centers on her family and a fantasy . she wants to be a singer . did you know kathy bates has a beautiful voice ? i was shocked ! she adores a british singer played by jonathan pryce . just as she is about to get tickets to see her idol in person , her husband ( dan aykroyd ) gives her the news that he wants a divorce . this film is part musical , mostly comedy , part mystery and drama . it takes fox's death to teach grace ( kathy ) how to to live : a life lived in fear isn't much fun . grace's love is unusual because she gives it without demands . she accepted her daughter-in-law , who is a dwarf and named grace's only grandchild pokey . grace never condemns and still loves everyone . this is a quirky , bizarre , very funny comedy . grace eventually learns that there is more to life than being safe . we are prompted at the end to love unconditionally our family and friends , plus ourselves . that takes courage , but this film makes it work . the songs are fabulous and you can't help but keep singing them after the movie is over . special guest cameo by julie andrews is another treat ; she plays herself and sings too . there are many other cameos , like barry manilow and lynn redgrave . highly recommend you go rent this movie today ! !
positive	any high school senior will appreciate this flick . it seems everyone in this movie relates to someone you know or knew . a must see with friends , the more the better . don't forget your wood-shop projects . . . .
positive	just a wonderful movie ! lots of laughs , great annimation , murphy and myers were great . antonio banderas as puss in boots was a nice twist . the only part i didn't like was the fairy godmother . i highly recommend this one .
positive	concerning the misfortune ( s ) befalling a mother and her two children in 11th century japan ; an engrossing , lyrical , unsurpassed masterpiece of quite exquisite , aching beauty and devastating emotional impact , from the greatest of all directors , the prolific perfectionist kenji mizoguchi . wonderful beyond words . ( i'd like to add that the film has wide appeal , currently averaging 9 . 4 and 9 . 5 on the internet movie database and foreignfilms . com website respectively )
positive	this is a better movie for adults than for children . i think it is a little too scary in some spots for kids . that being said , it is a great movie and a perfect adaptation of the novel , charlie and the chocolate factory . gene wilder is perfectly cast as wonka and the collection of child actors is wonderful . it's kind of amazing , given the quality of their performances , that they were largely never heard from again .
negative	a truly unremarkably film , , , , but remarkable in its ability to trick people . brimming with unrealistic sentimental nonsense designed to tug on your little heart strings . which disguise the long boring plot and horrible acting of kevin costner . second to water world as the worst kc movie . and second only to titanic as the worst academy award movie in history .
negative	my husband and i both thought this movie was terrible . the visuals were the only good thing . the fight sceens were to hokey with all the flying . why did the girl take a horse when she was trying to save chow yun fat if she could just fly through the tree tops ? just to silly for words and a waste of $ 15 . 50
positive	too funny for words . total , utter , silliness and well worth watching .
positive	this one wrapped everything up just like it was supposed to and then some . sith was much better then the previous two and is as good as the first three . lots of action and a few suprises with a nice steady pace . the best movie of the summer , really !
positive	scarface is a classic . this has to be the all time best movie in history . the ending was tight . it would have been better if he blasted everyone though .
positive	i was impressed at how faithful the movie was to the book . i noticed that some parts of the book were left out only to learn that they were left on the editing room floor . after giving it a second thought i realized that it was better this way . seeing how idiots like axlrod2003 can't stay focused for two seconds . if people lke him were forced to endure the extra footage it would surely drive them to suicide .
negative	i actually am a man who likes well-done dramatic love stories , really lol . but i am just like elaine on seinfeld , twisting in agony in my chair waiting for this yawner to end .
positive	i thought this movie was really funny . robert de niro does a great job with his role as an overprotective father . while i normally hate ben stiller , he was funny . it's a great movie to watch if you need to laugh .
positive	i am not a particular fan of tom hanks , but i have to say he really impressed me in this one . that giggle was brilliant , i thought i'd die laughing . i had no idea that this was a remake , but no matter how good the original was , this version certainly can match it . the coens are great . of course , it is not the traditional hollywood comedy , but thats whats so great about it . wayans was very criticised , i really dont understand why , i thought he was excellent . the scene when he remembers his childhood is even worthy of quentin tarantino . i enjoyed this film a lot .
negative	terrible movie . focuses on jesus' torture in attempts to guilt people into believing in him or going to church . where was the focus on his teachings and beliefs ? a big-budget horror movie and nothing more .
positive	this movie was great , but a little too gory . it depicted the war and the issue of trust and backstabbing very well . i usually don't like this kind of movie , but i loved this one .
positive	this is tied for my # 1 movie with one flew over the cuckoo's nest ( 1975 ) .
positive	the matrix is the best movie . watching it a first time isn't enough , surely my favorite movie ! the effects are awesome keanu reeves is so hot ! if you haven't seen this movie yet , go out get it !
negative	as a geo-science major in college -- i have to say this movie breaks all rules of geophysics --- and really just basically sucks . what a joke -- especially the insta-freeze of solid objects like buildings . another hollywood pos offering .
positive	one of the best all time movies ever made . i loved it , aboslutly loved it . i just hoped they went into the lives of these great pilot's a bit more . such as : by the end of wwii yeager had shot down a total of 13 enemy aircraft . that in 1954 yeager retired from testing rocket aircraft and returned to military flying only . there is no mentoin at all about wally schirra's six orbits in oct . 62 . the most exiting details of gordo cooper's flight were left out , how he flew his spacecraft back after 34 hours and a ship that all systems were ethier dead or on there way . pancho barnes was indeed a test pilot , in 1929 she was flying expermintal aircraft such as the lockheed j-5 . she also owned and operated her own flying circus . the fire that burnt her club to the ground was considered suspicious because the air force wanted that land and threatend to condem her club , acting as her own lawer , she won her case and was awarded $ 414 , 000 . the scene where yeager loses control of his nf-104 and bails out happened 5 months after coopers flight and 15 months after nasa moved to houston , in the movie is is depicted during and before . all in all still one of the best movies ever .
positive	this is not the best film ever created but gets 5 stars for many other reasons . . this movie is a tradition that has always left me with a comforting sense with its' small town goodness . i always sensed those were better times when vitues and family mattered . . . teaches some very good moral lessons too .
positive	i have an obsession with this movie ! ! ! ! it is one of my favorite movies and as an answer to one person's question there's more than diggin' just happening , and i'd see a movie like that !
positive	a very good movie the plot was great .
positive	i'm sorry if the majority of teens today enjoy raunchy humor ( sarcasm ) . i'm sure people will stop making these movies when people stop watching them .
positive	i was actually pulling for the predators to prevail . those nasty serpent-aliens must be stopped before the whole of mankind is infected ! ! !
positive	this is only partly a cinderella story . what this is about is a culture clash , between your typical anglo-american-two-and-a-half-kids family and your enormous-invite-the-hundred-cousins ethnic family . it was brilliant and accurate . go see it .
positive	the first of 4 movies andthe scariest . shot in black and white on a shoestring budget . the tension inside the house gets thick enuff to cut with a knife . the dead come back to feed on the living and a group of strangers try to lock themselves into a farmhouse . this was remade in color several years later and the remake isn't bad . the second of the series is a must see .
positive	this is my favorite spacey film in that it really keeps you guessing until the end of the movie . the way the story unfolds is very unique and the character development is excellent .
positive	excellent disaster movie . i am a fishing-lover and i have experienced storms , waves , unexpected catch ( much smaller sharks ) , etc . highly recommended for fishermen and fishing-lovers !
negative	truly horrible . bad acting . every cliche in the book . dunst strutting around in tight , little shirts and panties for 2 hours wasn't enough to make this movie worthwhile .
positive	good enough to make you want to see to see it 10 times consecutively ( if not more ) . very sad movie . one of the saddest movies of all time . tom hanks did a really job at playing his character . see it as soon as possible .
negative	oh my ! people r gonna be sorry i rated this one . who could actully find this movie entertaining . theres ass raping on here . thats sick . to my fan : im sorry i couldnt make you laugh with this one , this movies disgusting . love you all killabuds4every1
positive	kubrik is insane ! he's also a genius , i've loved every one of his movies including this one . insanly bad ass !
positive	depicting a japanese architect's affair ( at hiroshima , in 1959 ) with a french actress , who recalls her wartime love for a german soldier under nazi occupation , this is a ground-breaking , and highly influential arthouse masterpiece . its intertwining of past and present , and of different personal and political experiences , is handled with rare sensitivity , elegance and wholly cinematic expertise . a challenging but refined , quietly moving and brilliant film .
positive	this is a great movie and a wonderfully written screenplay by matt damon and ben affleck . damon and robin williams are both excellent as the thug / genius and therapist , respectively . it also includes one of the greatest lines in recent movie history . how do you like them apples ! ! !
positive	very entertaining . its hard to not pay attention to this movie . i kinda have concern for anyone in a comma now . if you seen it you know what i'm talking about . they went way to far with the blood in this movie . it seems like even a minor papercut in this movie would shoot blood like a fire hose . but thats just my exageration . the action and the fighting in this movie are preety badass .
negative	adam sandler can't act . would someone mind telling me why he stars in so many movies ?
negative	with all the hoopla about this film , i determined to watch it . i'd heard that some viewers in the theater were so frightened that they would vomit , etc . well now i see why they were vomiting , but it surely wasn't from fright . the vomiting had to come from one of two sources : ( 1 ) bad popcorn or candy , etc . , or ( 2 ) the awful stench emanating from this terrible flick !
positive	matrix was a really good movie because of the special effects , music , costumes and actors . a lot of the stuff was new , so it was unseen , which made it better .
positive	i think this is a great movie . i have seen this so many times i know it word for word through the whole movie and i can do the fast-talking sequence ( what you wouldn't read about is how ray finkle lost his mind was committed to a mental hospital only to escape and join the police force under the assumed identity of a missing hiker manipulating his way to the top in a diabolical scheme to get even with dan marino who he blamed for the entire thing ) faster than jim carrey in the movie and yet i still laugh at the jokes . my favourite part is when ace turns up at ray finkles house and says hi , i'm looking for ray finkle then a shotgun is pointed to is head . he replies and a clean pair of shorts . and when asked over the phone by courtney cox where he is , he says i'm in phsychoville and finkle's the mayor . all in all one of carreys best performances . the sequel was crap .
negative	hunt for red exitsign was so bad . i hunted for the red exit sign , found it , and left . i cant believe anyone falls for this dumb over acted crap .
positive	sharks are jawsome ! !
negative	another movie on the sequel craze .
positive	great satire and a poignant message - the alex character is memorable . . .
positive	i don't know why this isn't in the classics . first time i watched this i thought it was absolutely hilarious ! woody allen writes the greatest one-liners , and diane keaton is great as annie hall herself . i consider this possibly woody allen's best film . even if it has a simple story it's still an absolute classic . summary : one of the funniest and greatest films ever .
negative	pocahontas is a 1995 disney film that is based upon the life of an indian woman a few hundred years ago and how her life changed when she became part of a man's life . it's as bad as it sounds , but worse . it is not what you'd expect from disney , and it gets too boring and annoying .
negative	grease is such an overrated movie . it's absolutely horrible and john travolta is lame .
negative	basically we have " the exorcist " meets " rosemary's baby " . if you enjoy special effects at the expense of character development and plot , by all means - indulge yourself . personally , i found this about as interesting as a trip through a meat packing plant on a golf cart going 120 miles per as i'm paging through a comic book of the gospels according to the mentally deranged . but , i won't go there since there isn't enough space on this page to cover the pathetic use and abuse of theology . i'll just sum up by saying ; not funny , not frightening - just near sited , ill informed and very , very dumb . i'll hand it to reeves though ; he apparently stays on top of the acting game just enough to get first choice at the high budget glitz - wherein his only requirement is to storm around like a male model with an inflamed hemorrhoid spouting what might pass as witty one liners - provided you are still in high school . it would appear that the formula is ; throw in enough special effects as camouflage and anyone can look like an actor . sadly , and for reasons i can no longer remember , i gave him a bit more credit than that . up until now .
positive	yes , yes , yes , fantastic movie . hitchcock's 4th best and in the top 50 for sure . best movie of the 40 besides double indemnity and the great dictator ( see those movies ) . interesting plot , best cary grant and ingrid bergman performances of their careers . ( woooo ! casablanca ! play it again , sam ! no , she's better in notorious ! ) . claude rains is particulary great as well but his performance in mr . smith . . . could be better . i wish i were more opinionionitive .
positive	i don't like prison films , but i made an exception for this one starring william holden and others . the scene where otto preminger puts on his cavalry boots to take the telephone call from berlin is priceless ! this flick still has some of that old thirties film noir flair .
positive	greatest horror saga of all time .
positive	one of my favorite movies of all time . well written , well acted , and the special effects were very good for the time .
positive	probably one of my all-time favorites . what amazing chemistry that the late john candy and steve martin exhibited in this film ! i was laughing my tail off every five minutes- there was never a dull moment . the two scenes that stick most in my mind is martin's rude comments to the lasy in the car rental center , only to recieve an equally rude you're f @ * % ! . i'm not too big a fan of the f word , but i thought that the way that martin used it was hilarious . and who can ever forget the best of them all : those aren't pillows ! . if you have not seen this , you don't know what your missing !
positive	it's a great movie !
positive	clints the man . what a tough dude .
negative	it just did not compare to my standard for great science fiction movies . it had a lot of forced dialog , which is always annoying , and it had lost the excitement and heroism of the first movie . it felt as if lucas cared more about presenting his hindu idealogy than about creating a great movie . i like science fictions that have more intellectual value , not ridiculous child play to the tune of eastern religeons .
negative	this is where it all started . meg ryan the cheater ! ! i have no respect for any person that can't keep her pant's up while she or he is away from the family ! ! !
negative	way too dark to be enjoyable .
negative	the title says it all . the characters have no motives or personality .
positive	i loved this movie . it does a great job of showing what life was like in the jewish communities of russia in the 1800's . it is both humorous and dramatic .
positive	breakfast at tiffany's- a timeless classic , the goddess audrey at her finest .
positive	one of the greatest films of all time . so entrenched in our society that we forget it's a movie . but it is , an important one to our society and culture . also , dark side of the moon goes along with it . and that's awesome .
negative	i hated it . it sucked dick . i really hated it . i liked it when they had sex . i liked a lot of the crazy stuff .
negative	it made me nauseous and nothing ever happened . it was horrible
positive	perry mason ( raymond burr ) is better as a bad guy .
positive	scared the hell out me !
negative	i love the nfl and i thought this movie did a horrible job of trying to deplict the life in the nfl . it was demeaning to the intelligence of both the fans and the players .
positive	this is my new fave movie . it's soooooo awesome . only one word describes it awesomness juila stiles and sean were awesome together ! it just makes me wanna get up and dance around ! ! ! ! ! ! its totally the best movie !
positive	what a wonderful family movie . i saw this for the first time almost 20 years ago in one of those huge theaters they used to have . a moving , funny , story about a boy and his friedship with an extra terrestrial . who is named e . t . the three children in the family try to keep e . t . a secret . after a short while e . t . wants to go home . so the kids try to find a way for him to communicate with his planet . of course when they find that way the public finds out about e . t . and tries to take him so they can experiment on him . the kids and friends have to find a way to rescue e . t . and get him to the ship . this is just a real feel good movie about the friendship between e . t . and elliot . all the kid actors are good . drew barrymore was adorable . this movie had me laughing . and crying . a well done movie .
positive	the original , a classic ! i remember the first time i saw to fly as a kid at the national air and space museum in washington d . c . walking into the theater and seeing that awesomely huge screen , literally holding onto my seat as my eyes were flooded with scenes of the world as seen from above . feeling like i was flying with the birds . i will never forget how that felt .
positive	i saw it at the age of 11 . . . . i cried , i loved it . what 11 year old cries when watching a movie . . . . . one that is truely moved by the story line .
positive	possibly the best movie eddie murphy ever made . who wouldn't want to hang out with billy ray valentine ? whisky . . . all you want !
positive	classic - watch it over on tape / dvd - better than ratings support
negative	when you've run out of so many stupid ideas for sequels that you actually have to take a camp killer into outer space , perhaps it's time to end the series .
positive	kubrick seems to be very good at suspense , and the mental torture of the characters is fantastic . the scene that always sticks in my mind is when you have the huge wave of blood crashing down the corridor . an excellent film with brilliant acting .
negative	this is the worst movie i've ever seen ! ! ! the only part that was funny in the movie was when he sarcastically said that a leaf would attack him . i can't believed i wasted 12 bucks ( half for me and half for my date ) to see this movie ! ! don't watch it unless your under 10 years old ! ay !
negative	unlike the novel by bret easton ellis , which is one of the best pieces of literature ever written by man , this movie was so horrible . i know this movie was not meant to have deep meaning to it , but it could have been close to the book , which it obviously was not . any true bret easton fan could tell you this . i don't think any of his books have been made into great movies to date , except for maybe less than zero . i do not recommend this waste of space to anyone . : (
positive	i know it has doctrinal points that differ from mine , but i don't expect doctrinal perfection from a movie . i liked the passion because it was powerful and moving . mel gibson put a lot of money and effort into this movie , and i'm glad he did . i went away with a renewed appreciation for the suffering and humiliation that jesus endured on my behalf . great movie , mel .
positive	great movie . almost made me cry . the d-day part was pretty sad .
positive	it was like psycho meets silence of the lambs
positive	best action flick ever , especially when it was released seen this movie so many times my old vhs tape literally wore out ( no word of a lie )
positive	this movie was butta ! ! ! it is one of the very best movies i've seen . one reason is because they showed the problems between whites and blacks together .
positive	spy kids was a great family movie , i would call it a james bond junior . most of the movies we end up taking our kids to have little or no parent entertainment value . for a family movie , it had a good mixture of effects , plot , action , suspense , and humor to keep kids and parents involved . the kids did not jump up to go to the bathroom even once , now that says a lot for a movie .
positive	well directed with a strange atmosphere . the actors were great and the dialogue was excellent .
positive	another outstanding performance by danzel washington , oscar should have been his this year .
positive	best of the three by far . absolutely beautiful photography , lovely story , and i like that he put arwen on the horse in the river , even though that wasn't in the book .
positive	one of the best movies i ve ever seen ! i cried twice , i doesn t often cry when i see a movie ( ok , when i was little yes , but not in an age of 17 ) ! i also liked the future design , all thought i thought some things was a little unrealistic ( like flying cars . . . what i liked was the clothes , the arcitecture , the human realations . . . ojal las proximas generaciones tienen tan bueno gusto ! really fantastic playing from a lot of actors actrisses , not only robin williams ! : - ) ) ( from a person that usually hates sci-fi )
positive	a winner . traffic is not for the faint of heart . you'll be on the edge of your seat from beginning to end as the story unfolds . who's a good guy ? who's a bad guy ? who can you trust ? will we ever see a supporting actor do a better job than benicio del toro ? who dangerous is the drug trade ? who's shielded from it ? if you've ever been a user , you should see this movie . if you've ever known a user , you should see this movie . if you've ever had a child , or think you might ever have a child , you should see this movie . and , make sure you know who you can trust .
positive	great great movie . very funny .
negative	i thought that meet the parents was one of the worst movies i have ever seen . i didn't care about the characters at all . we never got to fully understand ben his fiance's relationship , therefore not caring whether they got through this obstacle of meeting her parents . it wasn't funny . i was so bored and annoyed with the movie , i was actually looking away from the screen . i understand how nerve racking it is meeting significant others parents , but this was just too ridiculous . i do have a sense of humor and i do like stupid entertaining movies but this was just stupid . i thought it was horrible . the movie was so predictable so it took away from the funny parts since you knew what was coming up . i thought ben stiller was good . his fiance was not . robert deniro used to be great , he was okay in this movie . this movie just rubbed me the wrong way and i ended up walking out with 15 minutes left . didn't i want to see whether they get back together ? well , no . i didn't care at all . i also knew that they would since the movie was so predictable . i thought about it after i walked out to see if i was too harsh . . . . but i really didn't like the movie .
positive	one of the more funny modern non-disney comedy movies that i have recently seen , this one is great with the antics of chris rock and the sometimes-deadpan , sometimes over-the-top comedic timing of jackie chan . although not as good as the jackie chan cartoon , jackie chan adventures , it is still a good movie with lots of funny dialogue and fight scenes . i wish they hadn't used bad language , however .
negative	good movie for about 5 minutes during the introduction . goes downhill from there . saw it for free and still feel cheated .
positive	still the best giant monster movie even with the dubbing and cut footage from the original 1954 japanese version . raymond burr is quite good in this american version , it was the first movie to scare me as a kid and at the same time enthrall . i can still watch it over and over even today at 31 years old and get the same feelings it gave me back when i saw it at 8 .
positive	lol don't be stupid , be a smarty , come and join the nazis party . a hippie hitler . some funny sh * t
positive	despite the sometimes slow-moving pace of the film , i really thought that this was one hell of a thriller . it was not really scary , just very suspenseful and thrilling . i thought that the musical score was perfect for the film , and just made it all the more suspenseful . yes , some parts in the middle dragged on , but in the end , it was well worth the wait . it became predictable in the last 45 minutes of the film , but i never expected quite the ending that this film provided . i have never watched a scene in recent times quite like the love scene when pfeiffer's character discovers that her husband ( ford ) was cheating on her with a student . fine acting jobs by both michelle pfeiffer and harrison ford , espescially ford , who truly showed his range as an actor , playing a vey different role than the good guy roles that he is accustomed to . he truly showed darkness both through his facial expressions and words at the end of the movie- his character just turned stone cold at the end : no emotion . this film had it all : suspense , a great plot , great acting , a great musical score and an eerie feeling that reminded me so much of psycho . i'd reccomend it to anyone who is looking for a film that even remotely resembles the work of hitchcock .
negative	how can they call this a comedy ? i don't think i laughed one time . sure wayne and garth were funny on snl but the movie is horrible .
negative	john " revolting " outdid himself here in trying to put some oomph in his scientology beliefs . this film is really awful , but you should watch it at least in part to get the flavor of the hilarious nature of scientology beliefs .
positive	this is a wonderful movie ! !
positive	a great and funny movie .
positive	using the original sets from the classic universal frankenstein movies , gene wilder as frederick frankenstein ( " that's fronkensteen . " ) creates his monster with the aid of his sexy blonde lab assistant inga ( teri garr ) , and his bumbling , bug-eyed , hunchback igor ( marty feldman . ) mel brooks' was huge in the year 1974 as he released his two most noted films 'young frankenstein' and 'balzing saddles' to the delight of comedy fans everywhere . here he parodies the original 'frankenstein' , 'the bride of frankenstein' , 'son of frankenstein' , and 'the house of frankenstein' with a few musical comedy numbers thrown in for good measure . madeline kahn , kenneth mars , and gene hackman provide a series of hilarious send-ups as elizabeth , ( frederick's fiance ) police inspector kemp , and the blind man , while peter boyle uses grunts , growls , and facial expressions to breathe life into his portrayal of " the monster . " wilder is his usual sometimes calm , sometimes exasperated self as he attempts to interact with this group of crazies and use his genius to carry on with his famous relative's work . cloris leachman is a laugh riot as the former girlfriend of the senior frankenstein and current housekeeper for the castle . one of the best comedies of all time and well worthy of it's lofty rating among the entries here . do yourself a huge favor and see view this film . you might pick up a copy of 'blazing saddles' and make it a double-feature .
negative	it sucked a fat one
positive	a real classic movie . would have liked to see a sequal made .
positive	definitely hysterical .
positive	awsome , i can't say any more . a modern classic
positive	obviously since this is a mainstream family movie i was skeptical about jack blacks ability to be entertaining without black swearing like a drunk sailor to communicate his disillusionment with the establishment . however , one wonders , where does disillusionment with authority ( or as black puts it the man ) begin ? in school of course . so therefore who better to teach a bunch of impressionable youngsters to question the hegemony of the man then jack black , who is keen to wildly instill a sense of rebellion as he turns his class into a fully fledged rock band . as always , black pretty much plays himself but with a sensitive tinge when he consoles the various rock and roll acolytes when they doubt themselves . to me this is more than just a feel-good comedy with a stadium rock twist ( which it's pretty good at ) but it's a modern day parable about how children and adults alike have forgotten their dreams , forgotten how to have fun and forgotten even how to rebel ( this is shown in how the flamboyant and wild metal bands of old which black touts are unknown to the children and repressed by the adults ) . this film is cleverly analogous of how modern day rockers have forgotten the purpose of rock and roll ( his students suggest the point of rock and roll is to score chicks or to get loaded ) . this film curiously embodies the true spirit of rock better then most music videos ever could in that it shows the characters are able to once again forget their inhibitions , question authority , express themselves and ultimately stick it to the man because that , my friends , is what rock is all about .
positive	what's my tatoo say ? dude . . . no tell me what it says ! dude ! what's mine say ? sweet what does it say ? sweet dude ! sweet dude sweet
positive	one of the funniest yet heartfelt films i've seen in a long time . keaton and nicholson are terrific !
positive	when you read the plot and read what the movie is about , it sounds completely stupid . but if your patient enough and give it a chance , you'll find out that it is a very funny movie . sigourney weaver is extremely beautiful in this movie ( which is probably the reason i really liked the movie ) . tim allen's acting was well done .
positive	a great movie to scare the crap out of anyone .
positive	this movie was really good . and even more , the special effects were excellent . especially the scene with all the tornadoes in los angeles . this movie was cool , but i'll admit , it did scare me .
positive	i think this movie was the best movie of the year .
positive	great actors great story . . . can't go wrong !
positive	this is a very good movie with very meaningful morals i am glad they covered . it covers the meaning of freindship and what true beauty is . it also gets the point across that disney movies are lame . shrek has enough crassness to be concedered modern , but also has enough wonderful messages to convey and original ways to convey them that it is ahead of its time . remember beauty and the beast ? how the beast turned into a handsome ( by most peoples standards ) at the end ? expect none of that in this film . love can come from inside from your heart and it doesn't matter what the other person looks like . this film actually made me tear up in a couple spots . i also laughed my arse off in some parts . alot of parts come to think of it . this movie is great for all ages . and i mean that . i think some jokes could be over some kids heads . but you know youth today . they have all that crap on t . v . and porn on the internet , i am sure they'll get most of them . a great film about the power of love and friendship . highly recommended . good date movie .
negative	this movie was so cliched and predictable that i found myself crying and laughing with insanity at the same time from the stupidity
negative	awful movie with a screwed up history , lots & lots of errors , mel gibson ( william wallace ) would have been 350 years old with this hollywood boloney . . . .
negative	this was ok the first 529 times i watched it , but after that , it got kinda boring . anyway , now that i am grown up , i prefer more serious movies , like hellraiser iii .
positive	a great movie . . . gained new respect for nicolson . . . . it tugged at a lot of emotions . . . . dealt with issues people my age face . .
positive	eisenstein's legendary silent milestone- possibly the single most important and influential film in the development of cinema as an art form . depicting the 1905 mutiny by a disgruntled battleship crew , joined in revolt by the civilian populace against a brutal tsarist regime , the film goes far beyond political propaganda . with its masterful symphonic structure , prodigious choreography and above all the dynamic and suitably revolutionary montage editing ( peaking in the celebrated odessa steps sequence ) it remains a highly impressive accomplishment . strike ( brilliant also ) , october , alexander nevsky ( stunning black and white cinematography ) and ivan the terrible 1 and 2 ( daring , operatic style ) are other eisenstein classics worth seeing .
positive	a classic court drama , and tom hanks was perfect .
positive	direct , simple western ; but a great political film at the same time , one of the best in timing in all the history of cinema ( it happens in real time .
positive	almost everything you could ask for .
positive	kate hudson is very funny i liked it i really thought it was funny .
positive	this movie gives a wonderful new spin on the idea of improvization . the witty lines and amazing ability to sing brings out a tun of laughs . . . this is a must see . . . eugene levy is amazing and so it katherine o'hara . . . the whole cast used their unique acting abilities to create a wonderful master piece thank to you all
positive	enter the dragon is the best bruce lee flick ever made .
positive	this is the perfect scifi movie . it's funny as hell and features an all star lineup : bill paxton , sigourney weaver , and that one dude .
negative	pathetic
positive	crazy , crazy movie . i still hate cgi . the story is very quiet , and beautiful , despite the hellraising action scenes . i think i'm in love with the main character . i was afraid to see it , because i don't want to get sucked back into the world of video games ( this movie is based on one ) but i'm glad i rented it . donald sutherland's gentleness , power , and intelligence were perfectly cast in his role . alec baldwin brings his usual smarmy blend of machismo and whining . the tone is relentlessly dark , but the movie's filled with hope , and nobility . if this had been live action , it would be considered one of the best sci fi films of all time , but it's a landmark for the medium . strongly recommended .
positive	scandalous , heretical , and absolutely hilarious . john cleese's turn as the centurian correcting brian's latin is priceless .
negative	the absolute pits in horror movies . not one good comment about this no-brainer !
positive	awesome movie ! harrison ford and tommy lee jones were great !
positive	i don't care how much is incorrect , this was a great movie !
positive	a truly uproarious slapstick comedy from the late 50s , some like it hot provides humor on all ends of the spectrum , but is never really dirty ! from physical slapstick , verbal jokes , subtle flirt humor and ridicoulous situations . it would be almost impossible not to laugh at least once during this classic !
positive	i was very suprised at how well this movie did scare me . even to this day , it is creepy scary . i loved it and try to watch it every halloween . good !
positive	this movie will blow your mind . it will scare the living crap out of you and there is some dark mystery to some of the dialogue that you may not catch the first time ; it will surprise you . david lynch is a genius and dennis hopper will freak you out ! it's an experience !
negative	pure cut and paste . i thought documentaries were based on fact . a look into the mind of the hollywood left . they see the world as a big picture that is to be directed to their taste . even sadder are the mindless zombies who believe and base their arguments on this garbage .
positive	one of the most underrated movies of the year . could have been a little smarter in certain parts , but a lot of fun .
positive	stand by me is a great movie because each character is developed so well . we really get to know the boys and to empathize with their experiences . even though my childhood was very different from any of those characters , i felt that i was able to understand what they were going through .
positive	the credit showed early to be given when it is due . mr . smith did it again . this movie blew up the charts and rightly so . the presence of one vivica fox certainly didn't hurt . but the role of such major proportion being played by an african american was also a big deal by all accounts . this movie certainly gets a two thumbs up .
negative	writer eric kripke is a hack .
positive	without a doubt american pie is the best comedy of the '90's . it brought back that '80's sense of humor like in porky's . i loved it .
positive	this is the greatest horror film . it was weird and devilish . anytime you have devil like movies it freaks me out . i had to stop the videotape when i got scared .
positive	the perfect conclusion to the perfect martial arts film , kill bill vol . 1 .
positive	although not as powerful as the original 3 movies , lucas does a great job with the special effects and scenery in this movie . the landscape , not to mention natalie portman , are beautiful . all the other cast members , liam nesson , ewan mcgregor , and ray parks are perfectly casted . jar jar binks however , deserves to die .
positive	talk about a great movie , this is the one . if you've never cried or laughed in a movie then this is the one for you . it gave me a better understanding of how afro-americans were treated back then . it gave me a whole new outlook .
positive	wonderful drawings . i love the story , and the characters are more interesting and touching than some human beings . i also like the siamese cats .
positive	cameron diaz is so sweet sexy ! amazing movie ! : o )
positive	the film is so sweet ! i like it so much . . it gives me so much love and so i feel not so lonely . the sexy body patrick swayze * g *
positive	i now enjoy watching older films to experience a different way of life . refreshing . this film is exceptional with a wicked cast including the superb donna reed ( criminally underrated actress and as charming and sexy as ever ) an excellent montgomery clift and a very funny guy in sinatra . when the film concentrates on this trio it is a great example of hollywood cinema at its most accomplished , unfortunately burt lancaster and deborah kerr also star in this . no offense , lancaster is an adequate actor but he pulls off his lines with overwhelming hamminess and woodeness , which doesn't help when his character dialogue is so cheap and dated . kerr is a great actress and does her best but her lines are terrible also . those not used to films from the golden era may find this unintentionally hilarious to put it bluntly , but fortunately their little affair does not take up the majority of the film ( and that music is so annoying ) . from here to eternity is not on the film same scale or spectacle as the cr @ p pearl harbour with affleck et al , lacking its action and explosions and explosions , but it is exquisite film making and you really do feel for the characters ( lancaster and kerr not included ) . see this forgotten gem and get ready for one of the great films of the 50s . or just see it for donna reeds and monty clifts spectacular performances .
negative	pierce brosnan should stick to remmington steel because james bond was finished when sean connery finished . you are right , to world is not enough for . . . . me to poop on .
positive	this is one of those classical movies that unfortunately will never die . for a film of its time ( 1939 ) the wizard of oz boasts magnificent scenery , costumes , script , colourful characters and memorable songs . its one of the most popular holiday films and like it or not for people to remember it for many generations after its original release date are already speaking volumes of how popular this film truly is .
positive	for people who don't like billy madison that's assault , bruther . they picked the right actor for the job ( adam sandler ) the fat kid from the third grade me laugh .
positive	an absolute classic . who doesn't get goosebumps during those training scene when that song starts playing , and sly puts on his game face , and the blue collar residents of philadelphia rally around him . i mean come on , this is what the movies are all about .
positive	after watching this empowering film you will probably catch yourself whistling to elmer bernstein's theme to the movie .
negative	tuna and i agree that you should avoid this movie at all cost ! ! ! the dramatic moment was the execution and suicide . however the halle / billy bob plot wasn't exciting . they break up . they kiss . blah blah . i also love the writers for killing off the kid so his mother can have more sex with the old man . ( sarcasm ) .
positive	i was completely blown away on several levels by this hitchcock classic the first time i saw it many years ago . though he was an undeniably eclectic actor who brought to life characters from george bailey to elwood p . dowd and everything in between during his long career , this part still seemed fairly offbeat for jimmy stewart . yet , per usual he did an excellent job giving us one very confused individual who embodied all the internal fear , sexual tension and repression that seems to be the underlying theme in so many hitchcock thrillers . kim novak may have lacked stewart's range overall but was still a very good choice for her role as well . she conveyed just the right combination of beauty and eccentric mental ambiguity to make her character both an integral part of the story and fascinating love interest for stewart's scottie ferguson . this is an excellent classic film that will challenge your intellect as well as keep you on the edge of your seat .
positive	anyone who has rated this movie lower than a 4 is just jealous of eminem . i am not an eminem fan , never have been . i stepped outside of the box though and looked at this movie from a movie lovers stand point . it has a great plot . eminem screams talent when he is acting . i thought it was gonna flop like a fish . boy was i ever wrong ! ! !
negative	waste of time . good thing i didnt pay for that movie . only good thing that came out of the movie was julianne moore , shes somthing to look at .
positive	one of the best movies of all time . the scene where the terminator is in a bathroom cutting his eye is pretty bad , but that is the only thing i dislike about this great film . if you don't like roller coaster rides and great one-liners , stay clear of this one .
positive	jimmy fallon + queen latifah = 1 funny movie
positive	i thought this movie was intelligent , funny , and i highly recommend it . the story was completely original . when i went to the theater to see it , i had no idea what to expect . i didn't even know who john malkovich was until i saw his face . when i left the theater , i was shocked at what the movie had ended up being about . it was great . it was a bizarre movie , no doubt , but in a thought provoking way . i don't know how anyone can say that there is poor acting . did you even recognize cameron diaz ? i think it is great that she took the role even though she wasn't playing a beauty queen . the whole movie blew me away .
positive	a classic and scary
positive	i think farley was one of the funniest guys in the world and this film proves it . the best ones always die too soon . . .
positive	this movie was great ! it was very realistic and touching .
positive	oh spiderman . such a wonderful movie . great graphics . i want to fly like that . tobey maguire , kiersten dunst , they all did really really well . this had to have been a hard movie to make . all the technology that was put into it . but it was worth it . can't wait for spiderman 2 ! * whispers with great power comes great responsibility *
positive	this is the best movie disney did along with lion king . i have seen it 50 times and love all the songs . the best disney movies 1 . little mermaid 2 . lion kind and aladian . . . a tie 3 . toy story2
positive	i liked this movie because it was hella funny . it managed to make fun of or incorporate all the scary movies and put it in one . it was also cool because all the funny stuff was totally unexpected .
negative	this movie is too stupid . it goes beyond stupid funny ( like jim carrey ) , and stops at horribly stupid funny .
positive	imho so far it's the best movie i've seen in cinemas in the year 2001 . true that it hasn't been a great year , but true also that this is a good film . good storyline , good script , wonderful acting ( jude law and ed harris ) , good score .
negative	booooorrrrrriiiiinnnnnggggg ! ! ! ! !
negative	it was corny [ beans make you fart - come on ! ] is this funny ?
positive	a wonderful movie . it really has two plots in one . roberto benigni { sp ? } is terrific as a jewish man who in the first half of the movie fall in love and pursues the woman of dreams . the tactics he takes to win her over are funny and romantic . coming in to her classroom pretending to be an inspector , following her to the theater and taking her for a ride . etc . meanwhile the horror of the holocaust is closing in on them and getting worse . the second half of the movie is when they are married and have an adorable five year old boy . robertos character and his wife and son are taken to the concentration camp . the boy and dad are together . to keep joshua from the horrors of what is really going on he invents a game for the boy to win a tank . this movie has some comedy . but it is shows the sacrifice the dad makes for his boy to get him through this horrific experience .
negative	love stephen king , hate this book and movie !
negative	man , do i hate this movie . okay , so it was a little funny , but the story and voices were complete crap .
positive	i just saw the real eileen wournos on an hbo documentary . the physical resemblence that charlize theron had to the serial killer was frighteningly remarkable and her on-screen performance was worthy of an oscar . halle berry could take a lesson or two from her about oscar-worthy performances .
positive	so much better than the first part .
positive	it was a good movie . the acting was great , and it was a good adaptation to the book . it's worth watching .
positive	i own it on dvd ! great movie . love helen hunt
positive	my personal favorite in the trilogy .
positive	this was one of the best movies ever made ! the dancing was great & the soundtrack was awesome .
negative	maybe they should have consulted a movie planner !
negative	the worst movie of all time !
negative	it's amazing this insignificant , low-budget piece of crap garnered the following it did , seeing that it's one of the worst films ever puked out by hollywood . starring unctuous p . swayze , a clubfooted hoofer in need of acting lessions and pinchfaced little trollop jennifer grey , nice body , honker and all . the best thing about this turkey is the fact that it takes place in the borscht belt , oy vey , which harkens back to childhood memories in my long-distant past . even the dancing , the supposed strong suit of this attempt at making a movie , was predictable and hardly impressive . what would have made this a better movie is if grey did about fifteen nude scenes : this would have kept me from nodding off every five minutes or so . cousin brucie morrow's favorite flick , and that tells you plenty .
positive	this movie was first class- i loved it ! anyone who hears about this film will shrug it off as a wishy washy child flick , but as soon as they watch it , they will love it ! it is a very moving story , almost as moving as remember the titans or the green mile , in which faith and hope emerge through a child in which everyone refuses to accept . and plus- it was one of the few serious films in which jim carrey played .
positive	catch me if you can was a very cool story . i thought it was very enjoyable with well developed characters .
positive	excellent special effects ! i can't wait for part iii !
positive	its a great movie if you don't take yourself too seriously . this is not a movie meant to awe you with the acting . it is a movie meant to make you smile and laugh . in that respect its a success .
positive	i think that the music in this movie was awesome , which is probably why it's a musical . nonetheless , the movie rocked .
negative	i was suprised to see cats and dogs even make it to the top 300 here . it was just very boring and dull .
positive	put the god damn dog in the bucket ! that creepy cross dressing naked pee pee hiding man still enters my nightmares once in a while . i think this is the most frightening psychological thriller i have ever seen . strangely , i started to like hannibal and the demented relationship that he was creating with agent starling . i may be sick . but this is a classic that you can watch over again and still be freaked out .
positive	i loved ghostbusters movies . . . lovely
positive	a very good movie about a man seemingly bent on his own destruction . good music movie . worth seeing but not for the very squeamish .
positive	hella tight , but too short
positive	believe it or not my mom made me watch this . i was like oh god but . . . it is probably the best film that the great jack has ever made . if i am not mistaken this was made in the late '60s . omg i can't believe a movie can be so funny yet serious . great ! ! !
negative	go away pierce brosnan /
positive	you better run cause big john rambo is on the loose and is pissed of at that hick town and the damn sheriff . watch out cause rambo has his own war and he didnt draw first blood . this is an excellent outdoor film that makes you thirsty for revenge and blood . stallone should have won an oscar , best movie of that year as well . " he drew first blood ! ! ! "
negative	why even have this on the list . it's a zero !
negative	wait a minute . . . . this is supposed to be a comedy ? i didn't laugh a single time throughout this movie . in fact , i don't think any of the others i was with did either . the actual film it took to make this movie would have been better spent taping me scratch myself . who produces this kind of trash ?
positive	my name is dave . the first time i ever saw 2001 i was with my friend david h and dave k . i was trying acid for the first time , but they had it before . as soon as hal started saying , what are you doing dave ? we all started freaking out . it was great .
positive	good cartoon .
positive	it's amazing how they have sort of the big brother theme , where they are taping truman's life into a 24 / 7 tv show . it was really an intriguing movie .
positive	harmless and entertaining fare . i enjoyed it and thought it re-watchable enough to have tuned in more than once when i would see it popup in the tv listings . christopher lloyd does his usual excellent job as a bumbling , absent-minded professor not too far removed from the just as goofy reverend jim from his taxi days . michael j . fox doing some of his better film work if this guy had been born 10 years sooner he d have been a disney film regular he just has the face , voice and personality for it . the story was fairly unique and presented in a lighthearted amusing way . i loved the way the family kept fading away when things went wrong in the past . the sequels weren t hideous , but , as sequels often do , got lamer as time went by . overall , i think it has held up well over the years and is still a fun flick for the entire family .
positive	this movies was amazing . sorry kids , but this is no teenie bopper horror flick with jenifer love hewitt , this is accually a thought provoking movie . is the blair witch realy behind the murders , or was the tour group just in mass hysteria ? that is the question brought up here . i think that this movie tackles the issue of the dangers in believing in movies , the dangers of blurring the lines between fiction and reality . i thought the movie had great ensamble cast of young actors who hadn't been revealed yet , and the movie was very well directed although i watched the movie with commentary by joe berlinger and i wish the studio hadn't messed with it , but even through that it was an unbelievable movie . this movie is creepy as hell too , not while your watching , but when you go home and start thinking of all the freaky stuff that manifested itself throughout the movie . i really admire joe for tackling the sequel at a completely different angle than the original . i think this movie only did bad because people wanted it to . i recomend that those who have not seen it , see it , and for those who hated it , give it another chance through my perspective .
positive	a love this movie it is so funny and what to say about the song of penis
positive	if only i were as lucky as mr . bueller when it came to skipping class : ( . this movie is cute and funny and good for a laugh . i'd recommend it to anyone !
positive	this was easily the best movie of the year for me-much better than green mile , or mr . ripley . . what a wonderful story , and what beautiful scenery-made me long for the northeast . i was engrossed form tyhe first minute , and left feeling emotionally fullfilled , but not drained .
negative	if , like tarantino , you find humour in murder and torture then you're one sick mutha who needs pyschiatric help pronto . why this film has become so iconic i dont know . it's cretinous rubbish .
negative	i thought the stale nachos from the theater concession were the best part of this movie . it was a long drawn out film that never took the time to really develop any of the characters -- not even andy . and courtney love the actor -- someone please get me another stale snack !
positive	word to the wise , if you see christopher lee wearing one of cher's old wigs start running . and britt ekland is the most underrated actress of our time . even if they had to dub her .
positive	one of kevin spacey's best roles ever . a movie that can keep me guessing the entire way through must be an amazing film . this is one of them .
positive	very cool . about our relationship with our work and our need for self-discipline in it . also entertaining .
positive	french genius in every frame . magnifique !
positive	great acting , unpredictable , outstanding plot , a knockout ending . this is a must see movie .
positive	worst movie ever . loved it .
positive	this is one of the best movies i have ever seen , let alone horror movies . i have watched this movie so many times i have memorized almost every line . but the one thing that makes me want to watch the movie over and over again is jack nicholson . . . his expressions are hilarious ! his acting is second-to-none . . . one of my favorite actors . this movie proves that a horror movie doesn't have to have blood and guts and all that other good stuff to be scary . i think the idea of being locked in a hotel with my lunatic father who was going to murder me and my mother with an ax and chop us into little pieces is scary enough . this movie is outstanding and i believe it is not only the best horror film of all-time , but also one of the best movies of all-time .
positive	a great book because it keeps your interest all the way through ( kinda' like not having to put down the book ) . it deals with society's views about race and discrimination from a child's point of view .
positive	this movie scared the hell out of me . seriously .
positive	you've probably read the synopsis of the movie from the marquis , but what it doesn't say is that this is a fantasy adventure . it smacks of the darkest tales of the brothers grimm , and preaches the lesson that innocent children will prevail over thoroughly evil adults . okay , so they have some help from a fairy godmother , but they win and harry powell is shown to be the coward that we all knew him to be . laughton directed this tale with all the elements of fairy tales , with a dash of berthold brecht's german theater . was it art ? sure ! did it go over the heads of american audiences in 1959 ? you bet ! if you can get into the mood of the film , you'll enjoy every scene . this deserves a second look .
negative	no ! . . . no ! . . a thousand times no ! tupac is the busiest dead m * * * * * f * * * * * that i know . what ever happened to taking a 'final' rest ?
positive	i nearly peed my pants ! it is so funny . whoope goldberg is a gem .
positive	one great film . my favorite borgart performance . if you like bogie , you'll love this film !
positive	i'm going to punch you in the ovaries . will ferrel is hilarious and this movie is great . it did feel slow at points , but it was worth it to sit through those parts . i don't think i have ever laughed as hard in a theater as i did during the big fight scene . brick you killed a man .
positive	just happened to be on tv this evening . always knew it was considered a powerful movie , but never actually watched it before . watching it , i have to say it's the most touching piece of cinema i've seen since schindler's list . my first impression was : you know s * * t like that's happening in iraq right now . the second was : this should be required viewing for any soldier setting foot there .
negative	one of the stupidest and least scary horror movies i've ever seen . it was almost as bad at battlefield earth .
positive	a fun and charming movie .
positive	one of my all time favorite movies !
positive	the first mith coming directly from the films without a literature origin and in its first version it was the most human carachter in an animation protagonist .
positive	the best bond movie ever . i loved it .
positive	it really depicted , brilliantly , the innocence and the human side of the fab four . this has got to be the most underrated music movie / documentary of all time .
positive	i feel pretty , o so pretty , i feel pretty , & witty , & gay !
positive	action packed all the way . great acting . not quite perfect though .
positive	monthy pyton takes the price ! is there any better comedians than them ? hey ! watch out for the killer rabbit ! ! ! = )
positive	groundhog day is one of my top ten movies of all time ( even though my top ten list has many more than ten movies )
positive	i was dumbfounded when annette benning did not win an oscar .
positive	liz taylor and richard burton rip through the script and each other in a loud and messy movie . great stuff . you have to wonder if george and martha's relationship didn't mirror their own to some extent .
negative	drugs aren't funny unless the morons using them get arrested !
positive	although i'm scratching my head at the pg-13 rating for this tame movie , i must say i enjoyed it throughly ( to my surprise , both my parents enjoyed it as well ! ) . as a fan of the cartoon series ( i had never seen the first movie ) , i was not dissappointed . big aliens , hilarious banter and pop references ( from star trek to the weather channel ) are just awesome . plus , on the dvd , the blooper reel rocks ! highly recommended !
positive	even though i beleive this movie is a 4 , i give it a five to balance out those who disliked it , thus bolstering the grade a little bit . : ) i thought it was fairly interesting concept that was somewhat predictable . i liked the idea that would prove that innocent men and women get put to death each year by the state and how that really doesn't matter to those who are in charge . there was many anarchist measages in the movie which i found pleasing . ( by this i mean real anarchist , not the stuff those in charge like to scare little kids with ) most people i don't think picked up on that as well . enough with the praise , now for what i didn't like . kate seemed to breka into tears every few seconds even though the first time was really understandable . the character of david gale started off as some one you could almost like , but then he slips into blandhood which means by the end you really almost don't care what happens to him . this i chalk up to bad writting because kevin does a good job of trying to save the heart of the character .
negative	its stupid . if your wanna see this , why not rent a couple more movies that suck like the blair witch or maybe ticks .
positive	adventure , religion , nazis being vaporized , serpants , cryptology . . . this movie inspired me on so many levels .
positive	such a cute movie brought forth that whole spagetti thing i wanted to rent it for my daughter but it was rented out . . .
positive	wicked !
positive	i love this movie so much . i have collectibles from this movie and of course robert zemeckis is one of my favorite directors . i have yet to meet a person who doesn't like to watch this movie . this movie is awsome .
positive	i really liked this movie . mike myers did an awesome job ! this movie was sheer brilliance .
positive	this was better than the original version . much more information ! ! ! and totally hilarious ! ! ! i loved it ! ! !
positive	love eva mendez
positive	i thought the movie was going to be boring , but it was great ! legolas is so so so so so so so hoooottttt ! ! ! !
positive	a very offbeat comedy that offends just about everybody . taking place in the 60s or 70s ( when it was filmed ) , it's about an advertising agency with a token black guy on the board of directors . when the head guy dies and they have to select a new ceo , everybody votes for the black guy assuming that nobody else will and therefor they won't be giving a vote likely to offer them competition . he takes over and in his first speech says , " i just want you to know , i'm not here to rock the boat . i'm here to sink the f----er ! " the ads they produce thereafter are hilarious !
positive	i liked this movie a great deal . i used to watch it all the time . however , it is a shame that belushi is dead and that akroyd is old and fat . by the way danny , i loved your work in my stepmom is an alien .
positive	loved it ! ! a laff riot ! ! ! ! !
positive	thought it was very well written and i believe a lot of these things can happen in real life , so that made it extremely thought-provoking as well as frightening . actors were great - linda blair's best role and ellen burstyn is always the best .
negative	this was the worst movie ever made ! ! it was a waste of money and a waste of hype . the whole idea of not giving the actors a script is ridiculous . if there is no script , then how can any story be told . in my opinion , this movie was a waste of my time and $ 7 . 00 .
negative	just to tell you how much i hate harry potter / the movie / the books , i wish there was something less than 1 star ! ! ! i wish i could give it like a 1 / 18 of a star . i hate him ! people are getting too excited about this guy that does magic ! !
positive	best bond movie in years .
positive	elvis is the king and anything with him in it gets a 5 from me
positive	this is generally considered the best movie ever made .
positive	this is the best action thriller movie . if you are into bloody battles and heroes watch this movie .
positive	my favorite fonda movie . great cast , great acting . funny , interesting , and dramatic . actors of today couldn't get it done in a remake .
positive	a truly crazy movie that had me both going what ! ? ! and laughing at the same time . the way they played with words was the best , and i never get tired of this one .
positive	stanley kubrick is great . this movie is weird but it was great
positive	so rocked ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
positive	this flick is the best of the lot . it establishes the genre . now i'll admit that the first sequel or two weren't that bad , but overall this was the climax of the entire gaggle six movies . the last three were indifferent to stinker .
positive	pure action . the best vampire movie ever . action , love , supense , and very original . could have been a team called blade .
positive	still makes me laugh 'til i cry . christopher guest is a comic genius . all of his movies are comedy classics .
positive	satire at it's best .
positive	alex -- ahhh . . .
positive	this is one of the best and most memorable of the older disney animated feature length films . i still go completely misty when i see the part about bambi's mother . the voice of thumper is one of the cutest ever used in an animated film . a must-have for any disney film collector .
positive	the only good thing to come from the star trek universe since the tribble .
positive	fast paced thriller . did great justice to the old tv show .
positive	i personally love this movie . as a child it was the first disney film i watched all the way through , and i still love it today !
positive	this is one of speilburg's best films and it has a great cast . the editing for this film is amazing . especially when you have brodie sitting on teh beach looking out to sea to make sure that its safe and you have people walking past in their different coloured bathing suits and that determines how close the shot is on brodie . richard drefuss is amazing as usual , especially when him and brodie are trying to convince the mayor that the beach should be closed as there was definately a great white in the waters and the mayor makes a comment about him and he starts laughing . this film has the suspense element done to perfection , especially with that famous music signature . its a shame that they ruined it by doing all the other jaws movies .
positive	a misunderstood film . this story is based on an old chinese tale . . . yes , the flying is something you have to look past but our legendary tale of paul revere is just as fictional . cthd is one of most beautifully shot films i have ever seen . incredible cinematography , decent acting , terrific fight scenes . but it is simply a beautiful film to watch- the scenery , the costumes , the locations are just phenomenal .
positive	this is one of my favorite movies of all time . mel's performace is top notch here and the cinematography is breath taking . i agree that the battle scenes are spectacular and broke new ground . i want to add that the score to this film gives me goose bumps . it fits perfectly well with the scenes or just wonderfully as stand alone compositions . the music is just riveting . mel did a heck of a job telling this story .
positive	a great work of art by stephen king . brilliant , a masterpiece . very well written and thought out . the storyline is extremely tight & well constructed . this film should have won the oscar for best picture but unfortunately it came out the same year as forest grump . forest grump won the best picture oscar because it was oatmeal for the masses and could be digested easily . when i saw shawshank redemption in new york city you could hear a pin drop . that's how captivating a story it is . when the sadistic prison guard captain beat the new inmate to death the audience's eyes were glued to the moviescreen . the film speaks volumes about feelings of despair and hope . the count of monte cristo would have been proud of andy dufresne .
positive	it's a great feel--good movie . i can't wait until christmas time to see it again and again .
positive	rocky is a movie that can motivate even the most unmotivated person to succeed
negative	was this supposed to be overflowing with suspense ? * looks about * it's certainly overflowing with something , but suspense it is not .
positive	this movie surpassed the origional . i was quite impressed that it was not just a remake of the first one , as the entire setting and atmosphere changed . kevin mccallister's constant outsmarting of harry and marve was hilarious , even better than in the origional .
positive	overdone , over-acted , but what fun ! ! what will you do without freedom ? terrific action sequences . . . although where is the bridge in the battle of stirling bridge ? ! oh well , i don't want to be a spoil-sport and point out a few mistakes . a terrific movie .
positive	they use this script as part of the required text in screenwriting classes . 'nuf said .
positive	when i first watched the mash series , i was bored . but once you get into it , it is really good . the movie is no exception . it has a very happy ending .
positive	this is one of adam sandlers greatest yet and always will be to me . every scene remains clear in my mind and it still makes me laugh even though i'v eseen it years ago .
positive	one of the more actual scary mavies that has come out recently . honestly , how may horror movies actually scare you and make you jump ?
positive	martin scorcese and deniro are at it again with an almost hitchcock theme of terror . i believe both deserved the oscar and deniro made me want to root for the bad guy . juliette lewis is a hot lolita too .
positive	excellent movie ! ! !
positive	great movie , but i would file it under comedy ! ps : play the drinking game .
positive	one of the best comedies of all time
positive	my god . i don't think i have ever been so horrified by a film . one of the few times i have felt badly to be an american-the depiction of us standing idly by while this horror happened unnerved me .
positive	the special effects were really good . we got pretty dizzy .
positive	great camera angles and a great story , but can be a little slow at times .
positive	when i was a teenager our family first got cable tv in the early 80s and they would play this movie on hbo all the time . the scene where max's wife and child are killed gave me nightmares . the movie is an excellent story of a grief-stricken man getting revenge . the sequels were weaker and sunk deeper into far fetched science fiction and special effects .
positive	rob reiner hit it big when he directed stand by me , so he wanted to do a comedy that would entertain us . he spoofed fairy tales and stuff like that , and hit it lucky when he directed the princess bride . billy crystal was so , so funny as the elf , and fred savage was so cute in it .
negative	i liked it better the first time i saw it , when it was called brave heart . there were so many events in this movie that was a total copy of bh . it got to the point that i knew what was going to happen 20 minutes before it was even on screen . . . rip off .
positive	i think that this movie should be displayed more often in t . v . , people may actually change , i know i did .
negative	i thought it was awful . i don't understand what everyone was going all crazy for . it was really stupid , and a waste of time and money . there's really nothing to be scared about . it wasn't even a little bit frightening .
negative	[ just the sound of vomit ]
positive	one of the greatest dramas ever filmed . asuperb cast , fantastic story and great score . alec guiness as the crazed british colonel intent on showing british superiority over his captors by building a bridge that will harm the british war effort carries this movie . playing an american who escaped from the camp , william holden , turns in a stirling performance as the man who must destroy the bridge . a true masterpiece .
positive	this movie is great ! it has great special effects , for its time . absolutely a classic . this movie is awesome . really scary . i couldn't sleep that night ! i love all the gore !
positive	i have always been a fan of the alien saga and the second movie is simply wonderful . i was captivated by the first one and simply stunned by the second . i usually despise sequels , but this movie drew me in and held me tight to the very end . its my favorite , anyway . the traditional look of the aliens is held tightly throughout the movie and the new cast was wonderfully selected . i was also glad to know they kept the character ripley , who single handedly gave the move a kick butt feel . especially at the end , which i wont spoil for all who havent seen the movie . anyway , this is most definitely a head turner that should appeal to any fan of the first movie , or to anyone who can truly appreciate a good thrill ride of a motion picture .
positive	not for everybody . but for such a wonderful cast , and directed by tim burton this film to this very day is very under-recognized . it is my favorite film , i believe it stands above the rest and has a style and way of pulling the strings very well . pull the strings ! pull the strings !
negative	terrible terrible , o se habla espa ol , terrible . what kind of a name for a movie is that , clockwork orange . if i went to a movie theater watching this movie , i'd have to wear a paper bag over my head . nothing about this movie was interesting . i fell asleep , even though the theater was playing in surround sound .
negative	i spent most of the time trying to figure out what that piece of crap was and then i got bored and walked out .
negative	tediously unfunny scattershot comedy is a gross-out fest wasting all three of it's main actors . a bad rip-off of animal house with no merit .
positive	ok folks , it's not going to win an oscar and it's not going to be shown at the cannes film festival , but it is a great movie . piper perabo , who played the lead character violet has that aww shucks sexy girl next door look that you would either want for your daughter or girlfriend . the music was great and i personally like leann rimes who plays herself in this movie and does the actual singing . i like movies for their entertainment value . i want to sit down , relax and be entertained and this movie does that for me .
positive	one of the best horror movies i have seen in a very long time . i have seen it several times ( on cable ) & it never ceases to frighten . love it .
positive	this film is way better than the first one . it's really funny !
positive	this is one of those movies i did not want to see but was glad i did . a young man named rocky who is a boxer . is chosen to play against apollo creed a professional boxer . i loved the fact that this was a movie about the underdog . sylvester stallone was very good as rocky and he wisely showed the human side of rocky . with his dertimination to work out to be a good boxer . hs crush on a woman and his dating her . i found myelf realing caring about this character and rooting for him . a very well done movie .
positive	everybody remembers the famous line badges ? we don't need no stinking badges . the lesson , of course , is that greed is never good , and will wind up causing you to lose everything , and that's exactly what happens . not a completely satisfying ending , but i guess it had to be that way to get the point across .
positive	austin powers is full of laughs yeah baby ! !
positive	the best movie ever ! ! !
positive	a brilliantly written , beautifully filmed nasty story about a largely despicable man . not easy to watch , because it is hard to find someone to like , but it is a provoking , intelligent film .
positive	omg ! i went to the movies to see this movie . i thougt it was so scary . i seriously was like scared to look in my bathroom mirror for like a whole 2 weeks . i think michelle , whatever her last name is did a great job . . . i was like soooo shoked at the end . it was like whoa !
positive	experience charleston heston at his greatest when he utters the words , leave him alone , you damn dirty ape ! better than ben-hur , heston plays a marooned space captin confused about what planet he has landed on . the question is not where , but when . and with the creepy twilight zone ending , this movie rates 5 bananas !
positive	i am a bette davis fan , and this is without a doubt one of her finest films . she certainly was no beauty , but made up for that with pure unmatched talent in the roles she played . they just don't make em like they used too .
negative	when will these sugary old-farty musicals end ? please ! this movie is way too cheesy for my tastes . the singing made me ears hemmorhage ! bing crosby is a terrible singer and not good to look at . overall , this musical is as fun as anencephaly .
positive	one of the best movies ever !
positive	one of the all time greats ! the bicycle thief is a film you simply cannot help but enjoy , even if you're afraid of subtitles . the visuals are poignant , poetic and touching . the picture is also one of neorealism's crowning achievements ( and certainly desica's finest work ) . anything less than 5 stars would be a sin .
positive	forever quotable ! it's unbelievable that this 25 year-old comedy hasn't gotten stale . so many funny characters ( chase , dangerfield , knight , and of course murray ) . the story ( although uncomplicated ) is enough to join all of the hilarity together , but still allows all of the characters to be funny .
positive	the scarriest , therefore the best .
positive	fugitive was a good movie with a good plot . great acting job by the cast . the movie had nice getaways and action .
positive	james stewart is caught in the middle of an alfred hitchcock classic based in the bay area and san francisco bay . mr . stewart is a detective called upon to investigate a wealthy man's wife who has mysteriously died . mr . stewart , however , is caught up in a twisted plot of love and deception as the dead wife inexplicably reappears from time to time , and an even stranger love enters his life . highly recommended for those who enjoy a good plot twist and alfred hitchcock .
positive	hands down the most horrifying and convincing movie of all time . the acting was superb by both the mother and daughter . the topic was realistic and the characters really brought it to life . that and it's just plain scary . why is sixth sense above it again ?
positive	fast paced , humorous and a farcical delight . it pulls you in quickly and rarely lets you go . grant is at his best trying to keep all the loose ends tied together and the touch with his brother being teddy roosevelt ! ! a wonderful story .
positive	behind the exorcist this is the freakiest movie i have ever seen ! ! ! after the cat dies and then the kid , he plants them into the indian ground and they come back as not alive just evil . . . freaky ! ! !
positive	what a great date movie . it has it all , action , subterfuge , romance . it's so money . i don't think i have ever had a bad date when we watched this movie .
positive	bette davis and joan crawford did not share a mutual love for one another off screen , but the two of them together on screen was a fierce combination . you go through this movie thinking baby jane is the only evil one , only to find out the good sister hasn't always been so good .
positive	this is a freaking wicked movie !
positive	feed the birds tppins a bag toppins toppins toppins a bag . love that song . loved the movie . very origional and entertaining . what an awesome idea for a movie
positive	simply put , just a great movie .
positive	the first time i saw this movie , i was weirded out , but now i like it alot . very visual and strange , and with a great soundtrack too .
positive	this is one of my favourite movies . lisa kudrow is fantastic , as well as , the oscar-winning mira sorvino . it is a classic-humoured , most entertaining movie that you can watch again and again . it is stupid , but that's what makes it funny and what makes you laugh . it also , allows u to dream and wish about your high school and what your future reunions will be like , ( a bit of inspiration if u like ) . overall , exceptional and entertaining . a must c movie that's great 4 a rainy day .
positive	stella . . . . stella . . . . i read the play before i saw the movie and usually the movies disappoint after you read the play or book but 'streetcar named desire' is an exception . marlon brando is absolutely perfect in this movie . the acting was unbelieveable . i really liked the story . even though this movie is in b w ( black and white ) it keeps your attention the whole way through . definitely a time piece . you see the south ( new orleans ) back in the 60's . great movie .
positive	one time the oscars got it right . casablanca speaks for itself : of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world , she walks into mine . here's looking at you , kid . round up the usual suspects . play it again , sam ( misquote , but all part of the legend ) . we'll always have paris . i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship .
negative	garbage .
positive	vampires ! ! ! need i say more ?
positive	awesome movie . . . really interesting
positive	i've recently dubbed this the greatest super-hero movie i have evern seen . second , being the equally entertaining x-men . spidey has all the action and origin intrigue of a great hero film as well as some superbly directed shots . tobey mcguire is clearly a fantastic choice as exuberant yet nedry shy , peter parker . willem defoe is frightening in general . he's much worse as the green goblin . also , another benefit of having these actors is the smart way in which they pull off the typically comic book dialogue . both defore and mcguire give the movie some classy weight . . . as does kirsten dunst . one can hope this style of film making will be a constant throughout the budding spider-man franchise . . . . unless mcguire bolts or they get joel schumaker to direct , they should be fine .
positive	dark , existential and very nihilistic . ewan mcgregor showing again , that he plays darker roles far better . playing a drifter called joe who lives on a glasgow barge with an older couple . joe goes nonchalantly from one inapproprate sexual relationship to another , causing emotional distress in the process . seemingly feeling guilty and yet unable take responsibility for the behaviour his own insecurities have driven him to . this film has been dubbed 'last tango in glasgow' due to its the sexual intensity , which is usually barely simmering below the surface . like last tango in paris , the film depends very heavily on sexual chemistry , although by comparison the latter is more tender . the custard scene from young adam has acquired a certain kudos all of it's own and rightly so . it's very reminiscent ( without being too explicit ) of a certain scene in last tango . after watching it i was asking myself the question was she consenting or not ? although this in some way defines the film in that these women never reject joe , showing an emotional weakness on thier part too . overall , a challenging film which gives you plenty to think about both morally and emotionally , but probably not a good film to watch if you've just been dumped or were looking for a feel good movie !
positive	my number 4 out of the 6 , behind star wars , episode 3 and empire strikes back , but equally good in its own right .
positive	even if you find nudity to be offensive you'd still have to admire this man's struggle for his right to express himself . even if you hate hustler or larry flynt you'd have to admit that he has a point with his sex vs . war speech and how unfair it was to single him and his little magazine out when others like playboy and penthouse were perfectly legal .
positive	riveting ! this has gotta be my favorite film of all time .
positive	such a great movie about true friendship . i can never get tired of this movie- it is so funny and so 90's- you'll love it ! the acting is surprising good and not a bad story line either . can't wait for my 10 year reunion in 10 years to pull the i invented the post-it line- we'll see who falls for it
positive	i wasn't expecting much from this movie , but was blown away . my wife drug me to this and it was absolutely hilarious .
positive	this is a great movie . i consider it a classic . trippy special effects . scared the hell outta me , couldn't sleep for awhile , especially in the dark .
positive	the citizen kane of comedies . chaplin's brilliance shines in every scene and the intelligience of the writing is impeccable .
positive	with apologies to blazing saddles , this is the very best of the mel brooks movies . madeline kahn marty feldman are triumphant .
positive	not just a kids movie . there are a lot of jokes in it that many kids might not understand .
positive	this movie rocks ! ! ! couldn't have asked for a more thought out movie-ever ! ! from the plot , to the dialouge all tied together with the special effects .
positive	a fun summer blockbuster .
positive	everest was the first imax i ever saw and i was awestruck . the making of it and the production and the real life drama was spellbinding . imax is a wonderful new way to present media .
positive	very cool . the special effects are great .
positive	audrey tatou is practically edible in this film . it's about a whole lot of somethings / nothings ( mostly in amelie's head ) . great use of voiceover narrative as a comedic device--the main character has minimal dialogue yet her expressions married with the narrative lead to outrageous laughter . a cute love story . and the lawn gnome ! lol ! ! !
positive	one of the scariest movies that i have seen in a while . it is even more scary because there have been people who have said that this type of thing happened to them .
positive	i love a great head trip !
negative	if there is a zero in the rating system , i would give it to this movie . it could be that this is 'the biggest wast of time ever . . . ' . i lost 2 hours of my life watching 'stupid movie' .
negative	i've seen this ridiculous movie and it doesn't move me . it's boring . what does it mean ?
negative	was going good until it got to the court scene . horribly edited and was very boring .
positive	island of the sharks is my most favorite imax movie ever !
positive	this movie has set the standards for horror movies in the nineties . the way that the movie uses comedy along with horror is a great blend of movie magic . also , the blend of keeping the audience guessing until the end is now a classic mainstay in today's movies .
positive	i still can't take a shower , annother good head trip
negative	i want to say i enjoyed but i didn't it . nearly fell asleep . i'm surprised i didn't . i was disappointd and i don't think this film has anything good about it . unless your a 3d film fan , try to avoid . summary : a boring , stupid film that doesn't have much good about it .
positive	finally the shape has come back to review dawn of the dead --- mention to someone that you like horror films and chances are , they'll roll their eyes . and , to some extent , who could blame them ? we've had countless killers wiping out legions of co-eds , campers , party-hearty types , etc . a lot of blood has been shed , usually in movies with basically no plot , almost always not a shred of decent acting , and usually in a by-the-numbers fashion that concentrates more on gore than actually scaring the audience . dawn of the dead , doesn't forget that a horror movie doesn't have to stoop so low in order to set the mood . yes , it's gory , especially in the ending sequence . but it's not all gore . the opening passages introduce us to the plague that's turning the dead into the undead , hungry for human flesh . we see police officers re-killing people they've killed just minutes earlier . we see rednecks popping zombies and chugging beer . we see television reports about the plague , and religious types declaring war on the undead . george romero is smart enough to set the stage with these things instead of endless gore . the movie turns into a battle for survival , as a group of people settle inside a shopping mall to protect themselves from the zombie army waiting outside . in a nice realistic touch , the group eliminates the zombies inside , then grow bored by the hour , and much of the middle part of the movie concentrates on the small talk and chatter that goes on within the group . but when a renegade biker group decides to invade the mall , it opens the doors for the final battle , as hundreds of zombies make their way indoors , slowly but surely finding their way to their next meal . the final battle is gross , yes . particularly graphic and gory . and yet , i didn't mind . in a way , this really is a war movie . there's more action than scares , and as in any battle , things could get pretty disgusting in the end . don't hold the violence against the film simply for being a horror movie . it's necessary , at least to some extent . sometimes , a horror movie can be effective just by atmosphere and the classic man-against-monster scenario . the makers of dawn of the dead realized that . too bad other horror movie makers don't . the shape , card carrying film reviewer from around the way .
positive	classic bette davis . she's creepy and wonderful as the monster turned savior . great build-up and great ending .
positive	i was hesitant about seeing this movie when it premiered . . . i finally worked up enough nerve to view it . i'm glad that i did . stellan skarsgard was excellent as father marron ( ? ? spelling ? ? ) ! watching it gave me a lot of answers as to the why of pazuzu's existence in the first place .
positive	loved it at the time and have seen it many times since ( harrison ford is a legend , mainly due to star wars .
positive	just a wonderful , wonderful masterpiece ! one of my all time top 10 .
positive	this is a great movie . its up there with fight club . deffinatly a must see !
positive	an awesome movie by the don of avant-garde , mr quentin tarrantino . i do adore spaghetti westerns and martial arts movies ( as does tarrantino ) and this film was a little of a tribute to both ( even a few of the songs are by the western composer ennio morricone ! ) . david carradine is of course a star from a multitude of cheesy martial arts movies and yet his performance in this movie is enigmatic , measured , intimidating but with a sentimentality that makes one empathize with him ( which adds spice to the bride's ongoing fued with him , which is far more emotional then physical ) . uma thurman is powerful in this movie , of course she doesn't look glamourous at any time during the film , often she looks dirty , sweaty , frazzled , wounded and storied which is exactly the type of raw uncompromising image her character is meant to convey , so i say bravo ! it requires patience to view and fully appreciate this movie . this is the film's greatest strength and it's greatest weakness . the scenes meant to gradually build up tension and the ones containing oodles of esoteric dialogue will bore some but fascinate fans of tarrantino's style . a ponderous nature and originality is something lacking in hollywood these days and this film supplies it in bundles which is what i say makes this and all of qt's films rise above the rest .
positive	masterful movie - the acting is top notch and the cinematography is spectacular'
positive	the best of the series . no long intros , jump right in . it kept the swashbuckler spirit yet elevated the story to timeless myth .
positive	i really think that nick parks is a master of masters in the specialized world of puppet animation , and even though he did not personally move the puppets around in this , his first feature film , his eye for detail and his dry brit humor rings through . i saw a sneak screening and when the movie was over i hid in the bathroom and snuck in with the next audience just to see it again .
negative	this was junk . it was not funny at all . and there were alot of boring parts . this was not one of jim carreys good movies .
negative	let's get real , folks : this may be a trendy cult favorite , but as strictly a horror movie , it sucks . bad .
positive	one of the rare sequels that is better than the original . a must see movie for any fan of christmas or new york .
positive	amazing trilogy and this third one is really lovely . . . . great tolkien and great jackson
positive	angie jolie kicks ass in this movie ! it rox ! ! : )
positive	i really enjoyed this all time great horror movie . this movie had a great storyline and helped propel a stream of horror flicks such as nightmare on elm street . micheal meyers is probably the greatest , most unique horror character ever created .
positive	a cult classic but you have to see it at least once if just to realize how warped some peoples minds are out there and knowing they created this .
positive	you ` ve gone too far , you'll get caught first of all , you can never go too far , and second , if i'm gonna get caught it isn't gonna be by that guy .
positive	the acting was great . the story line was pretty good . the lines were well thought out . the sound track is good , well two songs are . overall one of my favorite movies . i found the movie to be very funny at times as well .
positive	the clowns saying negative things about this film are probably too confused to understand it- it was a great and exciting film
negative	josh hartnett delivers a fun performance in this putrid , unfunny god-awful comedy . ford is so mis-cast and wasted here .
positive	great movie one of my fav . although a lil unconfertable ( i cant spell ) to watch with ur parents i learnedthat the hard way . . . hahaha
positive	best movie of the year . the acting great , filming excellent , writing and directing beyond belief . finally something worth spending money to go see and not a remake of a big ape running through new york or a family who never heard of birth control . truly outstanding !
negative	there's no reason to even comment on this movie . it is horrible . you are making a huge mistake if you go see it .
positive	this was simply a great movie . brought out the former sailor in me and brought back memories of what its like to be at sea . if you want the full effect of the movie , see it on the big screen .
positive	no one should ever remake this movie . how could they do it better ?
positive	yeahhhhhh , this movie is hilarious . mmmmmkay ? thaaaaaaaaanks .
positive	everyone is forgetting how good charles demarr was . pure genius
positive	based on john grisham's popular novel , the client largely delivers as a suspenseful thriller . the plot revolves around young mark sway ( brad renfro ) who witnesses the suicide of a big time mafia lawyer . however , before the lawyer commits suicide , he confides in mark and tells him the location of the body of a missing louisiana senator . what follows is a thrilling ride , as the mafia seeks to silence sway while ambitious district attorney roy foltrigg attempts to find out what the young boy knows . meanwhile , mark seeks the help of an inexperienced lawyer , reggie love ( susan sarandon ) . the film is quick and thrilling , with very few slow moments in between . solid performances by all involved , especially the young renfro , puts the client over the top as a crime drama / thriller . overall , the client is highly recommended .
positive	one of the very best . i watch it almost every year and never seem to get tired of its hopeful message .
positive	if you want mindless , moronic action , this is the film for you . ( girls , don't bother clicking the no button , i just helped you out . ) jet li shows off his considerable fighting skills against the only worthy opponent they could find for him : jet li ! thank god this role didn't go to the rock , as it was supposed to . the great one is fine and everything , but i doubt he has the pinache for all of his smacketh laying downeth ability to properly club a guy with a motorcycle . very solid fx , with a sort of 'terminator' feel . the final fight alone is worth buying this flick for , no doubt about it . most people will hate it , but people take movies too seriously these days ( thanks , quentin . ) don't expect a great plot . it is , however , the best script jet li's gotten , and it shows . with the right lines , there'd be no stopping this guy . i'm nobody's bitch is a good first step , though . nice poetic justice at the end , resolving things into heaven and hell .
negative	like many of the raters here , i concur that this movie was one of the sorriest ever put out . it was hyped over the al gore-invented internet and that led to some fake buzz . i was never scared during the movie ; instead i got madder and madder as i sat through this crap . i wondered how i got took on such bulls * * * it as this ? this worthless piece of junk shouldn't be classified as horror . i've seen home movies with more terror than this . my first hair-cut on camera beat this crap . thank goodness now everyone knows this & it's crappy sequel are pure junk !
positive	i loved the battle at helm's deep and the part where the ents attack isengard .
positive	this is my favorite of the three . it's clearly better than the third , and i liked it a whole lot more than the first . it's got enough action to satisfy just about anyone , and all of the action is reasonable in my opinion . plus there are more than three characters that play an important role . i think it's a well-made thriller .
positive	dudes this is the greatest movie ever and i luv jason i hope he kills everybody in the next muvie an i am so glad he killed freddy cuz freddy sux go jason
positive	the best dang musical i've ever seen . . . brilliant effects . . . cutting edige cin-ematography . . . great soundtrack . . . . nicole kidman is the perfect actress for her role . . . ewan macgragor is hot . . . . the intergration of old and new music was so awesome ! ! ! ! diamond class movie ! ! ! i lvoe it . . . i do not want to give away a plot becuae you have to see it to belive it ! ! ! one sweet movie ! ! ! ! will chicago live up to this . . . we'll have to see about that one ! ! ! ! ; )
positive	the goofiness and silliness of the characters gives the movie its own beauty .
positive	i love this movie ! it teaches people that popularity isn't everything . i loved it !
negative	i hope it isn't bad as most dtv ( direct to video ) disney releases .
positive	my all time favorite movie . did anyone notice plastic jesus playing during carrie fischer's seen in the latest kevin smith film . one of the greatest scripts ever written . i guarantee you've heard someone quote the failure to communicate line in the last week . mellencamp quotes luke on the track scarecrow . guns n' roses uses a byte from it to open civil war . ronald reagen quoted it during the state of the union address . ethan hawk quotes it in reality bites . hey guys , how many times have you seen one of those sexy scenes of a gorgeous woman washing a car seductively ( liv tyler was a recent one ) ? you've got this film to thank for it ! oh , anything that sweet has just got to be named lucille . one of the greatest things about this film is the fact that it leaves it to the viewer to decide for themselves exactly what the details of luke's life are . the parking meter tells you everything you need to know about him in the first shot . also , the two speaches to god are two of the greatest ever filmed . * * * * * +
negative	will someone please stop banderas before he acts again ! !
negative	the movie starts off right but something goes terribly wrong in the middle . cyber-jason ? wtf !
positive	this is a hilarious depiction of the 1970's high school experience . a dope filled tale of rebellious high school graduates getting wild on grad nght . entertaining .
positive	this is one of two of my favorite movies . humphrey bogart was at his very best as the cynical and disillusioned rick blaine , who is brought back to life , so to speak , by love and and a cause which is bigger than him . what is amazing about this movie is that the script was written daily . not even the writers knew how this movie would end . it is a testament to the talent of all involved that this movie was even made , let alone become a classic for the ages . my personal favorite scene was when , paul heinred as victor lazlo and conrad veidt vied for dominance with their respectives patriotic songs . it was an unbelievably inspiring scene . no one but ingrid bergman could have portrayed ilsa , she owned the role . this movie also included one of my favorite character actors , s . z . sakall as carl . it was movie making at its finest .
negative	far too much talking . absolute crap
positive	robert deniro is as ususal very very good at what he does . this movie scared the hell out of me .
negative	miserable , excremental , asinine garbage . its gags are obvious , predictable , and without exception loathsome and lowbrow . the movie was about as funny as a burst colostomy bag , and about as subtle .
positive	see it in the theater , if possible . the cinematography is spectacular !
negative	i loved the first movie , but this movie . . . oh , man , they could have done so much with this , but it seems they chose not to ! in the first movie , they handled the cg and special effects beautifully , but in this one , it seemed they slacked off quite a bit ( not that i can do better , but that scorpion at the end was mind-numbingly horrible ! ) . and the zepplin . . . oh , that was a bad idea . and , since sais originate from the 1600's in okinawa as a farming tool , it's kind of hard to accept that ancient egypt possessed these things as weapons back then ! doing the face-in-the-sand thing in the first movie was kinda cool . doing the face-in-the-water thing in this one was repetative . and , for the rock fans--he's only in it for all of maybe two minutes , one of which is spent in a horrible cg replication of him . you'd be better off seeing scorpion king if you want to see him . altogether , if you want to watch it , by all means do so . . . just know that you've been warned !
positive	macho with a soft side , whodunit with a quality story , pathos and some good action scenes , though it's not action the whole way through . sweet goodytwoshoes lady in detroit took in numerous foster children through the years but actually adopted four of them that were in unique ways unadoptable / degenerates . anyway , years later she is shot , prompting her four now adult sons to reunite and seek out the truth about the shooting . recognized most of the actors , though can't recall names , except mark wahlberg ( one of brothers ) and terrance howard ( one of cops on case ) . motown soundtrack . i think most everyone would enjoy this never boring good-vs-evil redemption movie , though some bad language and a bit of violence and sexual explicitness .
positive	and not just cause johnny depp is beautiful
positive	a film of enormous scope , breath-taking beauty and thought-provoking drama , the searchers is the movie for many people . its influence is seen all over the films of such great directors as spielberg , lucas , scorsese and coppola . john ford made many great films , but the searchers is the one for which he will be remembered .
positive	super ! i've seen dozens of times & it still grabs me . the writing is superb , the acting terrific & the tension really builds as the alien slowly picks off one at a time . the best scene is where ripley ( after everyone else is killed ) almost runs into the creature on her way into the shuttle . it's creepy as it sneaks around the corner . also horrifying is where the alien comes upon parker & lambert while they're collecting up the coolant . if you're a horror / sci-fi fan , you must have this in your collection !
positive	this is such a great film . i it's my second favourite horror film ever after halloween
negative	not funny ! ! !
positive	this movie is a work of art . the way it was shot in yellows and blues was great to illustrate the emotions buiding up . it shows how people will kill each other over ignorance .
positive	lovely , the only true fairy tale ever filmed . great acting and great editing , which , in a movie is half the film . nice humour and a truly magic quality that autoiroby enhances rather than diminish .
positive	yes , you guys are on the money ! top 15 of all time ! jimmy stewart and hitchy are amazing ! and ruby , is there something wrong with a director being an artist ! ! ! you quote artist like its a bad thing . do you go out to movies just to get a quick laugh or scare or go to be entertained and think films that try to be art are stupid ? ? ? ? ? well they are ! j / k , to criticize a film for being artistic is absurd .
negative	way , way , overrated and overhyped just like the kill bill movies . warped and twisted just like every other film tarantino does , but when you have a twisted mind what else can you do ? i challenge tarantino to make another genre of movies . if he truely has talent ( which i doubt ) it will show .
positive	my childhood , and the childhoods of those i know would not be complete without this movie . the cartoon , not the crap jim carrey one . . .
positive	i was shunned among my friends for saying the first one was better .
positive	i love this movie . it is so funny . mike myers plays austin powers so good , no one could do such a good job as he does .
positive	the movie was excellent . i have a beef with mr . bruckheimer , did he actually think car buffs would not notice that the resurrected eleanor is a mercury cougar xr7 and not even a stang ! maybe he should hire someone with a little continuity . still a good movie just disappointed about the ending .
positive	this was an outstanding movie . action picked up at the very end . i was thrilled throughout . good actors . good storyline . good movie .
positive	i have always been a fan of this movie ! . . ever since i was small . . it always seem to shut me up ! ! . . and seein it at imax was cool ! !
positive	the original 1970's version is trully one of the worst movies ever made , ranking down there with peter frampton in sgt pepper's . the reason i gave this four stars is for the 2000 remake , which i believe was released direct to video ond dvd . that is the version that deserves * * * * * ! ! it is tremendous . check it out if you have never seen it .
positive	i love it ! especially when the fat one went up the ring !
positive	the in-laws is a classic . peter falk and alan arkin are hilarious together . just thinking of the word serpentine makes me laugh .
positive	i think this was one of the scariest movies i ever saw . i thought it was hella good . it kept me jumping and screaming .
positive	i am all for movies that made from real life drama . in my opinion , i hope that it struck a nerve in the medical community . i don't know about you , but i get sick of being treated as an insurance claim when i walk through that emergency room .
negative	i dont know why everyone likes this movie it is bad . it isnt even that funny . robert deniro i dont know what you were thinking when you agreed to do this movie . dont see it is bad . and i hoe that the sequil is called meet the faukers
positive	i loved it . ladder 49 is a great movie about the firefighters life . i'm a vol . firefighter / emt and i geuss i'm close to movies like this i will add it to my collection of dvds .
positive	undoubtedly the best and most thought provoking , fantastically acted and electronically manipulated futuristic film of today .
negative	dragonheart was such a terrible and embarrasing film . the whole entire plot and all of the bad acting , it was just really bad .
negative	the special effects hardly make up for what the movie lacked in plot . besides , it promotes animal cruelty ( i overheard someone saying that the movie sucked , but the coolest part was when a dog's head was crashed against the wall . . . i bet they went home to try it . ) .
positive	i finally saw this movie and it was awesome ! ! ! i think what put the icing on the cake was kevin spacey . . . he played his character so well i think i'm gonna name my dog verbal .
positive	why is rum gone ? this movie has it all ! fights , comedy , you name it !
positive	wow its a classic
positive	this is , i think , the best war movie ever made . i had to struggle with the idea that paths of glory was better when i said that , but they both come from kubrick , so make your own decision . the point is , the direction is all that a combat correspondant could ever , ever hope for . it may not be war , but it is what war should be in the cinema . i read the book it was based on , and while there are differences , i think the movie flows as well as the novel ; that is , the division bewteen the boot camp sequences , and the battlefield sequences is essential to illustrate the horror of war , and the degrading , terrible things a man must put himself through to get there . they are essentially a couple . if you look at the sniper in the final run as a metaphor for the enemy , the movie becomes more profound . ultimately , i've watched many a war movie , and i can't think of a better one to recommend , sans politics and propaganda , than this one .
positive	what can i say . . . hitchcock was a genius when it came to suspense and horror . psycho is a masterpiece . this is as good as classic movies get .
positive	i can admit it : i cry every time i watch this movie . i loved kevin spacey , and as a whole found the movie to be very moving .
positive	i never want to go in a corn patch again ! ! !
negative	barbershop 3 : give it up
positive	an absolotely fabulous movie . it was one of those times when you are sitting in the theater and not wondering who is crying , but wondering who is not crying . i was deeply moved , seeing how much christ really suffered . its an amazing movie that i recomment everyone to see .
positive	great movie ! the cinematography , direction , script , and soundtrack really propelled this movie . very true to the cynicism in the dating scene , the difficulty for young men to relate to the world ( parents , women ) , cool metaphors ( christ in the church , the fishbowl , him in the scuba gear , ms . robinson in the hallway after he spills the beans - all symbols of alienation ) - the hip style of this film is superb . copied by movies like ferris bueller . very dark , chic , hip , urbane , funny , witty . i like movies that leave you wondering . they symbolize where men and women are headed in the future and what they ultimately will mean to each other . i also like how we never really know what's in his head - he's more a symbol than a character . all of that and the soundtrack leave a haunting image .
positive	an amazing film , ridly is a master
positive	drama-wise , i thought it was better than the musical version .
positive	poopy
positive	just saw this movie tonight . cuba gooding jr and robert deniro were a great team ! they portrayed their characters in a very honorable way which showed great respect for our men and women in uniform . keep up the great work cuba !
positive	i loved this movie . even though it is a hollywood farse that is weighted by inspired by a true story . inspired being the very key point . this movie kicked ass ! the cinematogrophy , directing and acting , along with great special effects made this a spectacular thrill ride ! read my full review : http : / / bradley . kicks-ass . org / blog / archives / 000948 . php
positive	one of my favorite films . beautiful story , photography , performances and music .
positive	i never get tired of this movie . a great story , good acting , and some unbelievable action - the train wreck is especially compelling . there is something riveting about stories which deal with the wrongfully accused - and the fugitive is mesmerizing throughout . probably my favorite harrison ford movie , and tommy lee jones is superb as well . also , you have to love the simpsons episode which begins with bart writing on the blackboard i will not tell people my homework was stolen by a one-armed man .
positive	this was hands down the best movie ever made ! ! ! ! i love this movie i whatch it every day with all my cats . . . binky , jo jo , lala , harry , lloyd , mary , jesus , waka waka
positive	david fincher is god ! ! ! ! !
positive	it's not supposed to stimulate your mind , but it's a damn funny movie . stills makes me laugh harder then any other movie .
positive	i saw this movie with a friend of mine and we both loved it . it was kinda scary , but i really loved the actor that played the priest . he is worth seeing .
positive	set it back 500 years and this is the stuff of shakespeare . the detailed story of neil mccauley ( robert deniro ) , trying to run a robbery while dealing with a psychopath who was once in his gang , and vincent hanna ( al pacino ) , the cop who will do anything to stop him . by far michael mann's best film , this complicated film with so many details , so many stories , is powerhouse stuff . not to mention the cast ! deniro , pacino , val kilmer , jon voight , ashley judd - - if you haven't seen this film you can't call yourself a movie fan . the whole film pulls you in , and it has the best bank robbery scene i've seen . see heat now . summary : a complicated powerhouse film that pulls you in .
positive	feris buellers day off is a classic , the acting , scenery , plot , cinematography .
positive	i thought that this is one of the best romantic comedies since as good as it gets . it is rather coincidental that both of these films revolve somewhat around animals ( the dog in as good as it gets and jinxy the cat in this film ) . i thoroughly enjoyed this film and laughed my tail off from start to finish- there were a lot of funny and memoriable parts that will always stick with me when i think of this film . the acting was supurb and this movie was great- anyone who thinks otherwise is just a focker .
positive	forget schindler's list : this is much better ! best film of '98 ! best non-english film ever ! : o ) ps : do anyone know why la vita bella wasn't nominated for one single golden globe , when it was nominated for seven oscars won three ? ! ?
positive	billy bob's best performance to date . he's hardly recognizable , and without a drop of make-up or latex . an absolutley heart-wrenching story , with some of the best quotable lines of any movie i've ever seen .
positive	a fantastic movie . i always love bogey , but even hepburn is great in this one ( she's great , but not one of my faves ) . reminds me of swept away . . . a bit ( the italian classic , not the dumb madonna crap ) . there's adventure , comedy , etc . , but there's an undercurrent of sexual tension in it - note the metaphors , her having an orgasm going down the rapids , and them getting it on by the middle , when they've fallen in love . every romance adventure movie since , like romancing the stone , uses the same plot devices , character development , etc . despite all that , you really see first rate acting . these 2 shouldn't work together , but they do . i almost wanted to do hepburn ! made me rethink the idea of missionary work .
positive	right up there as a classic .
positive	i love them all , but i must say this is my favorite of disney's animated features . it gives little girls an intelligent role model and the moral of the story ( it's what's inside that counts ) never gets old . of course , the animation and music are wonderful .
negative	yech ! ! two bad the writer didn't have one .
positive	vin diesel is soooo sexy ! i saw this movie 3 times and i wanna see it again ! it's so cool !
positive	one of my all-time favorite films ! the doors have always been my favorite musicians and val kilmer's performance is one of the best in cinema history if you ask me ! he looked and sounded like morrison in every way ! excellent film !
negative	horrible movie for a very overrated kids game . it might as well have been in french .
positive	who keeps giving these movies 1's and 2's ? ? ? there are very few films that surpass seven samurai , in the entire history of filmmaking . it is surely kurosawa's best ( ok , so maybe not surely ; rashomon is pretty spectacular as well ) , and it puts to shame the overhyped american classics like gone with the wind and a streetcar named desire . watch it ! and watch all the other great foreign movies ! if you don't , you're missing out on a treasure trove of genius .
positive	this is the best movie i have seen that i will never watch again . i was so scared after this that for weeks i had to turn every light on when i walked through the house . i was living with my mom and her husband and on the walls were pictures of his family , so from those old pictures of the 20's where they were farmers and didn't smile . i just had a creepy feeling that i would bump into them . i loved the suprise ending that i had no clue of until the wife dropped the wedding band . i was pobably still crying when we were driving home from the theatre .
positive	shrek 2 is a great movie . it's one of those rare gems that kids and adults will get a kick out of . like the first one , it pokes satire at everything with rapier-like wit . the computer animation has also imporved since the first . sometimes , i thought they were cutting into real world footage for some of the shots . disney really hasn't made anything in years that matches the humor and cleverness of the shreks . shrek is even strong enough to withstand the eddie murphy curse . the only knock i have on shrek 2 is that it is not quite the equal of the first one . but other than godfather 2 , what movie sequel is ? it will win best animated feature at the oscars .
positive	both jack nicholson and helen hunt perform great . the story is realistic to life . lots of actual nyc scenes . the dialogue is meaningful . the little cuba gooding jr . also did a good job .
positive	this movie was very ahead of its time and is still a good movie today . probably the most justified violence of any movie
negative	boring , with cheesy effects , and a annoying robot .
positive	khaaaaannn ! ! ! ! !
positive	another great star wars movie ! ! ! loved the ewoks !
positive	francis ford coppola at his best . this is coppola's rendition of the classic heart of darkness , set in the vietnam war . a glimpse into the primitive evil inherent within men-see it . the cinematography is awesome !
positive	i thought this was an excellent movie . very touching . the relationship between the father and son , how it changes and develops , how the characters react to kevin kline's cancer and what he's doing or trying to do before he dies is interesting to watch . it's a movie that makes a person think . i might be a little slanted in how i feel about this movie because i have cancer but i think anyone would like this movie . it's mostly about relationships . husbands , wives , children , ex's , neighborbs , a whole web of characters .
negative	not scary
positive	i think mel gibson did a great job , for his first time directing . the camera angles were perfect . the language really fit in with the scenery . people think the movie is grusome , but that is how it really happened ! they are just showing you what it was like for jesus , and if you didn't like it then thats your own fault . i perticuarly liked it !
positive	the princess bride is such a cute movie . it reminds me of my grandfather , he would always read fairytales to me . all of the cast was wonderful . every child should see this movie . as wesley would say as you wish .
positive	showed the world what special effects were all about . way ahead of it's time back in 1977 . unforgetable , in a word .
positive	empire was the perfect second act . star wars introduced the characters , created the rules . empire brings up the conflict and jedi resolves it . from a directorial standpoint , empire has the least lagtime . it's tight , compact with no excess wonderful stuff .
positive	definetely the best of the 4 movies . had a better and more mature story line to it , just like the book , and for the most part , stayed close to the book . the characters were better played , and the new characters ie : cedric , fleur , krum , cho , etc . were amazing . great special effects in the challenges , especially the dragon scene , and very emotional and scary .
negative	should have been called dumb and if you pay to watch it , you are even dumber ! most comedians don't know the difference between inspired lunacy and the regular , tasteless kind and this is definitely the latter .
positive	bergman's most brilliant , radical and original masterpiece , voted by international critics one of the all-time top 10 , examines the relationship between an actress recovering from a breakdown and the nurse caring for her at a remote swedish seaside cottage . a challenging film , but intimate , perceptive and extremely rewarding . the acting of bibi andersson and liv ullmann in the lead roles is quietly astonishing . essential viewing for lovers of arthouse cinema .
negative	what was the point of that movie anyway ? i wasn't even scared , just very confused . . .
positive	doctor- is there anything we can do for you ? mcmurphy- ( holds up the naked-lady playing card ) do you have her number ?
positive	i think pulp fiction was a awesome movie and quentin tarantino is one of the best directors in hollywood .
positive	this movie is good , especially how kirk out smarts the superhuman kahn . kahn is a funny character . he is smart , has a sense of humour and is controlling .
positive	the best pixar film of them all . glorious animation , and a hilarious performance from albert brooks . flawless .
negative	one of the worst movies ever made
positive	everytime you watch it you see something different and new .
negative	this movie was really bad . it was boring , not funny and pretty dorky . it could have been way better , just change the screen play .
positive	i hate and i mean hate golf but this movie was so not about golf . i was so shocked that i loved this movie as much as i did . i watched this one afternoon when i had nothing better to do and nothing was on . after 10 minutes into the movie i was so happy i stuck with it . robert redford once again made another great film , with a great cast ! ! !
positive	a great , influential film from kurosawa .
positive	mr . pink has this movie discription down perfect it is a great low-buget movie it is among my top ten i try to watch it anytime i get a chance . i first watched it at a friends house the later i rented it and watched it all 5 nights i also highly reccomend it to anyone who has a good sense of humor and well anyone who likes good movies . send more police . . . -smart zombie
negative	if there were a marking for zero , i would definatley put it down . as a fan of the show , i'm a little insulted . this movie was incredibly lame and jessica simpson made a horrible daisy duke .
positive	perhaps one of the best movies of our recent movie times . the acting , directing , and overall production of this movie are superb -interlacing several stark stories surrounding drugs in our society . at times you forget you are watching a movie it becomes so real . a must see for everyone .
positive	it's one of my favoriot movies of all time !
positive	one of those movies which you could watch over and over again . . .
positive	have to give it a 5 due to the acting . parts of the storyline were not great , but how can you not love ellen burstyn , sandra bullock , maggie smith , etc . ? well worth watching .
positive	i am not an adam sandler fan and saw this movie merely for the sake of drew barrymore , who i believe is the future of this country's acting . i was so pleased with the movie , finding it a very funny , and touching movie . i will give adam sandler a second chance .
positive	i was epecting a good movie . this one passed my epectations easily , the acting was superb as denzel always is , the plot was well written . when this movie was over i wished there was more .
positive	x-men was a good ass movie , and it stayed good enough with the comic book .
negative	i really enjoyed the first one but as much as i like austin powers i hated 2 . it was not really very funny with a lot of bathroom humor , more so than the first . one spy spoof was enough mike look for some thing new . i have not seen 3 yet but it looked about the same stuff re-hashed . update : i have seen 3 and i was right .
negative	they suck , and mic's got a big mouth . great for cock sucking . . . . .
positive	i think this was an amazing movie . the best lord of the rings movie ever . the huge battle was just breathtaking , i've neven seen anything like that before . peter jackson left a legacy and i could watch that movie every day . one of my all time favorite .
positive	one of the best movies i have ever seen . beautiful to watch . humorous details throughout . yet has a serious story -- the search for one's life meaning -- told metaphorically and directly , with humor , pathos , even an element of suspense / mystery . all the characters are well-developed and fun . different story lines to keep one engaged . i highly recommend this uplifting movie . when i saw it in the theater the whole place was laughing , often . ( warning : this is an adult movies and is in french )
positive	about a half an hour into the movie it abandons any notion of plot in the battle of zion . its an hour of explosions , debris , and screaming . it was absolutly wonderful . from neo's crucifix pose to the oracle in the end of the movie the religious backround of the movie is also more obvious . if youre a hardcore fan of the matrix you will like this movie . the wierd thing is this movie isn't even the best in the trilogy . i could type a hang of a lot more about this movie but just go see it .
positive	i was fortunate enough to get to see this on broadway and i was captivated . . . so naturally when the movie came out i was really excited . i loved the fact that in the movie they add a background story for the phantom . it is a beautifully done movie .
positive	i liked it and can't understand why this movie is at the bottom of the list . the actors were great and it had quite a fascinating cast . the setting in dallas was interesting and there were some funny light moments . richard gere is always great .
negative	man shoot willes , than he talks to the boy , of whom you know he talks to the dad
positive	franks and beans ! ! !
positive	one of the most beloved movies of our time , and rightly so . growing up i always anticipated an airing of the wizard of oz on tv . what a treat it was , to be taken to oz , to escape from the real world , and be apart of something so fantastic and beautiful . its sometimes hard for me to think that shirley temple was actually considered first and foremost for the film , as dorthy is supposed to be just a child . i doubt the movie would be the classic it is today , without garlands brilliance , and amazing voice . somewhere over the rainbow , strikes a cord to all whom listen , and its probably the single most definitive score in cinema history . a tale of 4 wayword souls , on a journey to become " complete " find along the way that they didnt need anything to prove their worth , it was inside them all along . and our beloved dorothy , finds that , through all of lifes struggles , what matters in the end , are those whom we love and love us , and indeed there is no place like home'
positive	this is one of the best imax ovies i've seen . the music was spectacular and the animation was very original .
positive	hysterical comedy on a scary subject . brilliant direction from the master - kubrick . performances from sellers , scott and hayden are first rate . highly recommended .
positive	i loved this movie ! at first it was hard to understand but then i caught on quickly . it was jam packed with action and it had a really good plot to it .
positive	best in the series . great scene with party and pool . freddy posseses nerd and rocks the house . the kid in this looks like the kid from christine . totally surreal scenes done with miniatures .
positive	this is one of the most inventive and just the most awesome movie ever ! i just got the special edition dvd and i watched it the chronological way , which was really cool ! if you can't figure out how , go to eeggs . com .
positive	this movie was so unique and fascinating . however , it was a case of you either loved it or hated it . the narrative storyline is so interesting and the characters are uniquely quirky . the dialogue sticks out as one of the most innovative things about the film . just a great creative vision and well worth several watchings .
positive	very entertaining and not difficult to follow . it is more exciting than mi one . the motorcycle scene was the same as in top gun . i thought the soundtrack to be haunting . the shots from australia made me want to go there .
negative	did not care for this movie at all . a total waste of time . do not recommend it .
positive	they shot this outside my apartment for a while , so i had some personal interest in it . trivia fact : the cops' badges read nowhere city . nifty ! this movie is a lot lighter than all the other versions of this story , and guy pearce is a lot more accessible than george pal or the cheesy mustache guy who played the inventor in the 70s version . also , his character gets a name , and the dinner party guests who were known only by their professions in the book are subtracted . there's a new romance , and a best buddy character , who were both played well . the morlocks are very scary and their hive is reminiscent of scenes from aliens , very well constructed and shot . the eloi are sleepy sun people who play angels to the morlocks' devils , and illustrate i think compellingly the flaws of a society that is entirely innocent and positive while still being more desirable than the alternative . why they were apparently based on the maori is unknown to me . it's not a movie huge on action , but the drama and the wonder are still there , even as jeremy irons's super-evil baddie slithers and sulks his way around the screen . it reminds me of those great old mgm classics , a fine family picture for a quiet evening at home .
positive	one of the best movies of the year
positive	clearly the greatest action / super hero pic . of all time up to current movies !
negative	too corny for me .
positive	it is the best movie ever ! !
positive	it doesn't get much better than this !
positive	a shamelessly funny look at brian who is falsly accused of being the messiah . he's not you know . any way brian gets in to all kinds of trouble with his big nose and with the pythons at the helm it could not be any funnier . you can't have a baby ! you don't have a womb ! ! !
positive	very good film . i had been anticipating this picture heavily ever since i had fallen in love with thora birch in american beauty . i was not dissapointed with this movie which is based off a sorely under appriciated graphic novel of the same title . this movie takes place following the graduation of two teenage girls who have always planned on moving in together and being forever friends . their pleasure is scrutinizing and making fun of strangers . one day they are reading the personals and come across one that a man has placed seeking a woman he met on a plane ride . the two girls find this utterly pathetic and deside to call him , pretending to be the woman , set a date , and then go watch him as the date never shows up . thora's character then becomes curious about the man ( steve buscimi ) and slowly grows attached as her best friend slowly grows away from her . thora is in top form in this bitter comedy . she has mastered the bitter girl and i can't wait to see her in her next film . simplistic in form and mature in subject . very good movie . highly recommended .
positive	the feel-good comedy of the christmas season ! ! ! the michelle williams character to the heath ledger character : " i knew you two were up to something on your fishing trips when you didn't bring home any trout . . . . . " you said a mouthful , honey . but beware . . . lots of man-cuddle action . kind of like mid-night mass for the gay community , no jokes allowed . . . . ever so serious & we must be ever so reverent & not joke about like sounding titles of a humourous nature . . . . . boom-boom mountain , smelly tent mountain , nervous sheep mountain , ky mountain bloody stool mountain etc etc etc ad infinitum . . . . amen . we kid around because we love . actually unlike any movie any of us have ever seen . . . . . . worth 9 bucks , i suppose .
positive	a wonderful movie . i really enjoyed the characterisations and performances by the entire cast . jess' neighborhood is an analog of every middle-class family's neighborhood throughout the world .
positive	i have seen a recent poll that has compared lord of the rings with the godfather , citizen kane , and other great movies . this was amazing because the poll was top 100 movies of all time and lord of the rings was # 1 out of those . the movie has great sceanry and has you wide awake 100 % of the time . this has won afl's best film of the year . and is rated for golden globes . this was the best film of the year and should win the best picture . the income for this movie is passing harry potter , because the people who have seen the lord of the rings hav loved it . if you havent seen this movie , you should see it now .
positive	this movie was excellent in portraying post-traumatic stress disorder . the performances were great and the twist at the end was entertaining ( with chris rock ) . the dvd is great with all the extras . the commentary is very helpful and makes the movie even better when you understand the meanings behind everything .
positive	soooo scary . i was about 25 when i first saw this and was that shaken that i went home and slept with the lights on after checking under the bed like a liitle kid ! best horror movie of all time .
positive	i almost passed this movie by but was i very pleasantly surprised ! good cast and very very very funny . steve martin provides constant laughs and entertainment . not one boring bit in the whole movie . one of the films that i watch over and over .
negative	i have yet to see a movie as poorly directed , poorly written , and poorly acted ( except by jackman ) as this one . i was so looking forward to it , being a big universal monster fan myself . this movie was supposed to be a dream come true . instead i got a convoluted plot , with mediocre special effects ( a stephen sommers tradition ) , and the least believable romanian accents in the history of cinema ( including that guy at the beginning of eyes wide shut ) . this movie should be shown in every film academy throughout the world as a cautionary example of what happens when a great idea is given to a mediocre director who , by the way , believes he can translate said idea into a plot and screenplay . awful awful awful awful awful awful awful ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
positive	the benchmark for all horror films , past , present , and future . a classic .
positive	my second favorite animated movie , my first of course in the disney robin hood version when the main character ( robin hood ) is a fox and maid marion is a vixen .
positive	a classic
positive	a classic
positive	a classic
positive	this movie is great if you want to watch a film to make you chuckle ( particulalry if you've seen many of the brit spy film like james bond , the ipcress files etc ) . it doesn't really engage your brain but then does every film have to be heavy and intellectual ?
positive	i love this movie ! ! ! it iz the best movie i have ever seen ! ! !
positive	for music and animation lovers , this is your movie ! each animated story was different and interesting and was matched perfectly with beautiful classical music . watch it at the imax dome theatre and you will see what i mean .
negative	boring , uninspired , totally uncreative headache drama filled with bad acting and bad writing .
positive	i bought this movie on dvd without watching it on my brother's suggestion . he talked so much about this movie being one of his favourites , so i thought it was going to be great . the first time i watched it , i was dissapointed with the entire movie , except for the ending of course . then , i watched it for a second time , and everything came together . with the knowledge i had of the ending , it made the rest of the movie so much better . now , it is one of my favourites . i say i have watched the movie over 20 times , no joke .
positive	its crazy that jesus had to go threw all that for humans .
positive	blade had great special effects . the movie made me believe that there are really vampires out there .
positive	what a beautiful movie . it's as fun as a movie like 'goonies' but a lot more intelligent . it's a vehicle for any kid's dreams ; finding out one day you have magic powers , and getting whisked away from your humdrum life , to a world where everyone's on awe of you , and adventure and intrigue are everywhere . visually , it's perfect . the characters are totally believable , considering the unreality of their situations . i haven't read the books , but the number one complaint i hear from those who have is that too many of the details and the nuances that make rowlings such a great writer don't reach the screen , but i understand that what is there is totally faithful to the novels , and it was more than enough for me . the quidditch match has been compared to the pod race in star wars ep 1 , and while i'm a die hard star wars fan , i think it's loads better . a must see .
positive	this movie almost made me piss my pants . more than once . but seriously , what lies beneath could be the scariest movie i've ever seen . when pfeiffer turned into the decomposed girl in the bathtub as ford was grabbing for her necklace ! holy mother make it stop . . . definitely worth seeing in the theater .
positive	i really like this movie , even though it was not that scary . the way that they would show the things from the movie happening to the people was cool .
positive	face off rules !
positive	i think this will be one of the all time great movie ever made . david lean's yet another masterpiece after the bridge across river kwai . excellent portrayal of a great man lawrence who defies all barriers in uniting the waring arab's under one fold . he makes the foundation of a nation for them . peter'o toole does an extra-ordinary job as lawrence ( unbelievable that this his debut film - how did he miss the academy award ) . anthony quinn , alec guiness and jack hawkins , omar shariff-full credit to their outstanding performance . no wonder it won 7 academy awards . see the restored version and the extra footage . i would recommend this movie as a golden collection .
negative	one of the only films where i walked out of the theatre within half an hour .
negative	national lampoon movies are very rarely ever good . they resort to lowbrow humor which send many running from their vcr ( i could never see a dumb movie like this making it to dvd ) . the acting stink and the jokes smell worse . go away , bad movie !
positive	a masterpiece .
positive	robin williams is hilariuos
positive	engaging , funny , sad , dealing well in both fantasy and reality , 'forest gump' is movie entertainment at its very best . i would even go as far as to say that it's the best film produced since the golden age of hollywood . tom hanks is one of the best actors of our time who has given us one of the most memorable characters on film . i'm glad i wasn't the only one able to see his talent since way back in the 'bosom buddies' days and hope he goes on to make more great movies with great heart like 'forest' .
positive	this is without a doubt my all-time favourite film ( at least until return of the king is released ) . peter jackson took more liberty with the story in this chapter , but the heart of the story is still very evident and the movie flows perfectly . the cgi effects , particularly gollum and treebeard were astounding and competely believable . i was also really impressed with how weta digital used their operation massive program to create the huge scale of the battle of helm's deep . the acting performances were note perfect as well . . . and i was particularly impressed with viggo mortensen . he's truly an old fashioned matinee hero in this film , who just crackles with charisma . john-rhys daveys was also brilliant in bringing comic relieg to the screen through gimli . . . and as well provided the perfect voice for treebeard . the only possible contention i have witht the film is the way in which faramir's character was adapted from the book . he's much harsher in the film , and seems to lose the beautiful , peaceful wisdom that he had in the book . however his role did need to be adjusted to allow for a proper climax to the film and i guess we'll have to wait and see how he develops in the conlusion to the trilogy
positive	keeps you on the edge of your chair
positive	one of the funniest movies of all times . king arthur vs . the black knight is the classic example of a lopsided battle !
positive	easily the best of the john grisham adaptations .
positive	a feel good film . : ) so much better than the shipping news in my opinion .
positive	this is one of the best moives of our time-a beautiful , painful and honest look at the biggest horror in history . spielberg is genius whose heart shines through the entire movie . marvelous actors like liam neeson and ben kingsley just break your heart . it is impossible to not be moved by this film .
positive	the 2003 videohound guide to films available on vhs and dvd says the following : a gentle alien lands on earth to deliver a message of peace and a warning against experimenting with nuclear power . he finds his views echoed by a majority of the population , but not by the ones who are in control . in this account based loosely on the story of christ , michael rennie is the visitor backed by the mighty robot gort . one of the greatest science fiction films of all time .
positive	awsome movie
positive	maybe it's because i grew up with it , but this musical is so whole some and naive ( if you can call a movie that ) . it kind of puts me in an idyllic state . it's kind of like a fairy tale .
positive	this is my favorite movie of all time because it brings hope to the audience in anything they face . the main character is spontaneous and likeable . the movie has a very good climax and surprise to it . it is a feel good movie of the decade . very inspirational .
negative	not funny . i didn't laugh once .
negative	i was expecting a lot from this movie . the graphics were good , but the story was awful . it was slow , boring , and very pointless .
negative	pointless child-like craziness . i could never even begin to imagine that this would ever happen off the silver screen .
negative	gwyneth paltrow should just stop making movies . instead of being a huge waste of time and money .
positive	again , it's not really a comedy . but it's a great fable about modern politics - specifically the beauty and depravity of human nature amplified through the tempest of politics . as dark as the film seems , its really about mixed motives and the tension between idealism and cynicism , romance and realism , and principle and pragmatism . its billed as a slam of the clintons , but actually the portrayals are very humanizing in that there are in fact strong core values obscured by the hypocrisy and corruption . i actually came away liking the clintons more . emma thompson was as usual just dazzling in her versatility , but travolta really impressed me despite the stereotypical depiction . i actually forgot that i was looking at travolta , whereas im usually annoyed with him half way through the film because he normally inserts too much of his own personality into his characters . the supporting cast was superb right down to the minor characters with one or two lines .
positive	this is an absolutely fantastic film that was made in 1975 . it stars al pacino as the main character sonny - he's trying to rob a bank helped by his friend sal in order to pay for his male lovers sex change . he had everything planned out ( or so he thought ) until he finds out that the money had already been removed before he had got there . so he decides to hold the bank clerks and manager hostage and the situation becomes desperate . the local police , led by sergeant moretti ( charles dunning ) try to get the situation under control , but because of sonny's charisma , the general public who are outside support sonny and the whole thing becomes a media circus . you do feel yourself willing sonny and sal to be ok and to live happily ever after , especially when sonny's wife and male lover become involved and you think they are going to get away with it . but it ends so tragically . this is a timeless film and really shows al pacino's magnificance as an actor and the script is amazing . if you are a fan of al pacino and you haven't seen this , i urge you to .
positive	this was a very funny and entertaining movie . i actually like george clooney for a couple of hours .
positive	thinking about taking that chick from logistics to the party . if everything goes right i'm gonna be showing her my oooh face ; you know oooh oooh . ooooh . i love this movie and it still makes me laugh ; even though i have seen it about 50 times .
positive	this one was funnier than the original . fat bastard was hilarious . mike myers does a great job at performing as multiple characters .
positive	rooney ? ! this is ed peterson !
positive	i figured it out pretty early in the movie ( kind of obvious if you think about it ) , but it was still fun to watch it unravel .
positive	very funny . i love the beatles
positive	batman has so many movies . i liked this movie a lot .
positive	best van damme movie but i liked it because im a fan of bolo yeung .
negative	vin disel makes an effort in this awful action thriller , that looks almost like a tv film . a man apart tells the story of a man who loses his wife during a shootout , and then decides to take revenge on the killers . the film drags on for about one hour too long , and the action scenes are overdone . disel is good , but his action skills are hardly anything special .
positive	scariest movie of all time ! they are making a new one and i want to see it .
negative	way too many adult jokes while the animation was pathetic . ( the fish looked like aliens ! ! ! ) overall the worst animated film of the year and quite possibly the worst animated film i ever saw ! ! !
positive	what is to be said about a movie that frightened me back in 70s and still can do so today ? i'll get straight to the point of why this movie worked so perfectly , whereas the sequels ( the exception being aliens ) did not . you actually get to know , and to like the characters . director ridley scott allows you to get acquainted with the 7 crewmembers . we get to see them carry on conversations and interact with each other for nearly 40 minutes . we see them awaken , eat , and work together . we see humor and tension as they socialize . then we see them exterminated one by one by a barely-seen presence known as the alien . we see the pain and hear the dying gasps of kane who unwillingly became the alien host . we see brett helplessly carried away into a ventilation shaft , and dallas without a chance to react in a dark narrow airvent . we see ash the robot betray the crew with their very lives on a heartless company order . we see parker beg lambert to get away as he sacrifices himself . we hear lambert cry and scream in shock and pain . we hold our breath with ripley as she trembles at the sight of the alien in her shuttle . all of this works not only because we know and like this cast of characters but because we only see glimpses of the alien , a biomechanical design out of the psyche of h . r . giger . ridley scott was smart to only show glimpses of the nightmarish creature . it leaves the audience with a gaping void left to the imagination . add the beautiful , eerie music by jerry goldsmith , along with a great screenplay and you've got the perfect formula for a classic horror sci-fi movie that has held its own for 20 years and will continue to do so .
negative	hated this movie . it was like going to a strangers high school reunion and listening to all their old stories . you just don't care about the stories or the people and it's boring .
positive	an amazing and powerful movie . a moving depiction of schizophrenia . well written and well acted . i could almost say that russell crowe is possibly the best actor working today .
positive	morgan freeman is always wonderful . this academy award winner is full of humanity -- what a nice change of pace from so much of hollywood . . .
positive	the coen brothers at their best
positive	excellent , powerful movie . richard burton and elizabeth don't hold anything back as george and martha . they go after each other with everything they got . one of the most volatile couples on screen .
positive	they dont make em like this no more .
positive	very realistic , wonderful acting , and story-line ! also with fairly accurate historical facts !
negative	i love musicals but i simply didn't enjoy this one at all . a big disappointment .
positive	this shouldn't be in sci fi , though it involves no magic . it's really psychological horror . cronenberg , who i'm now convinced was dropped on his head as an infant , does the same thing in another film of his , existenz but with virtual reality . videodrome blurs personal identity and tethers its characters to psychosis with brainwashing videotapes , that ultimately , along with the weird-ass score , create new nauseating depths of perversion . cool film . blondie's in it , and she's cute .
negative	this movie was lame . the whole train station scene was retarded . the french guy got punked out way to easy . neo fights like a sissy in the real world . then we're forced to watch morphus and the crew fly a ship for 2 hrs as the lamer characters defend club zion . the final fight was a dragon ball z rip off and the ending sucked big time . they didn't even explain anything it just ended with the old bag and the architect ( aka colonel sanders ) talking at the park . wtf ? o yeah trinity dies and so does neo . how do you like them apples ?
negative	not scary .
positive	davinci code lite ( in fact , did you catch dr . gates' alias was brown ) . but it was very entertaining and it was an outstanding family film in that my kids learned something by watching it . the on-location scenes , particularly in philadelphia ( hey look kids , i remember that was the place me and louie tunutos got a cheesesteak in 1979 ) , were great . i give it 2 thumbs , 2 big toes and a penis ( the cute blonde curator ) up .
positive	great movie with some awesome visuals . i liked the story as to why the vampires wanted to wipe out the werewolves . but i enjoyed the downfall of the vampire lord most of all . the whole movie was very well done .
positive	it's an even numbered trek movie , so it must be good . that's out of the way . the borg are an excellent , frightening villain , though the borg queen might have been more impressive . first contact with the vulcans on earth was a top ten trek moment . zephrom cochran sure looks different than he did in the original series , but who's paying attention . you have got to admit that the moments where picard gets accused of having an ahab thing for the borg , and when he calls worf a coward were exceptionally cool and well scripted . same as when worf responds by telling him if you were any other man i would kill you where you stand , and the eventual apology in which picard tells worf he's the bravest man he's ever known . data also makes good . the battle for the deflector dish was extremely interesting : i love how worf uses a borg's arm to seal a leak in his space suit . great effects , too .
negative	this movie was absolute tripe , awful ! ! you can tell the story was taken from a well written book and instead of being true to the book it was completely hollywood-ised , where half-way through we were seeing the whose who of hollywood which completely detracted from the movie . nicole kidman is a good actress , but this movie failed to stretch her ability or show any of her growing potential like the hours or the others . the accents were awful , if your getting paid $ 15 million for a movie the least you could do is show some respect to the audiences intelligence and do a convincing southern accent .
positive	seems so real . i wish i was scarface making money .
positive	update ; having seen this excellent film , the soul-love portrayed transcends the sexes of the people involved , and takes us on a human journey of love that , through fear of society's constraints ( not god's ) they are unable to naturally express . to conform , they get married and in the process hurt more people , yet not so much as they are hurting themselves . a film through which you will experience the depth of their love and understand that love is greater than the two protaganists . superbly acted . norainbows , if you didn't understand it , you've got a problem . not only has this film won the top prizes at cannes and venice but the film critics and reviewer's top award . it sounds a cracking good film and can't wait to see it . for those who think it's just a gay film . . well , above all , it's a love film and for those who think it's misrepresentative of cowboys , what do you think went on when guys were up in those mountains on their own ? louie : king kong ! my fears are confirmed that you have a lot of growing up to do , louie .
positive	this movie should be at least top 20 . i thought this movie had everything a great comedy is supposed to have . one of my all time favorites . it was hilarious !
positive	great ! i love star wars !
positive	the second best animation ever made definetly the best disney animation ! : o )
positive	now this boys and girls . . . is horror done right . not only one of the coolest ideas ever ( beat blair witch to the whole fake true story deal by over a decade ) it also presents us with a more realistic horror monster . . . the red neck . you watch this film and tell me you wouldn't be scared poo less if your friends were all being served to you while you are bound at the dinner table in a nasty house that has to smell like sh * t and be approached and taunted by a group of back woods hillbilly cannibals . would it not scare you to be chased through unfamiliar forrests by a maniac weilding a chainsaw and wearing a mask made of human skin ? there is no suspense just pure shock and terror . you see the horror through the eyes of the victims as well as the eyes of the psychos . tobe hooper did a great job with this picture . you can almost taste the putrid air of the leatherface clan's house . you can almost feel the hammer comeing down on the top of your head . it did for meat eating what psycho did for shower taking . a great classic shoker . highly recommend . a hell of a treat .
positive	finally snagged the dvd in order to get a copy that wasn't so severely truncated . this is the flick that started it all for me ; hokey and sexist in places , but the effects ! the krell interior shots carry me away each and every time . breathtaking for youngsters , but a fantastic blast-from-the-past for those who remember it .
positive	this film formed the major part of my childhood . sadly the following films lacked something in my opinion . so many great things in my childhood are based around this film . the acting , the special effects , at the time it was like nothing else .
positive	this is the best movie jackie chan and chris tucker are so funny and i'm glad they r coming out wit a sequel ! !
positive	great ! i think i'll get this one on video when it comes out !
positive	not too often do you get a set of dual performances as great as you get from tom cruise and dustin hoffman in rain man . classic lines abound , and good feelings grow in this movie . i think it ranks close to the best there are .
positive	hilarious watch it . do it do it
positive	i was expecting to enjoy it , but i loved this movie . it was absolutely hilarious , start to finish . i'm pretty picky about the dvds i buy because im broke and cheap , but this is in my collection . everyone in this film is great .
positive	amazing movie , great music , great writing , great acting , great story . . . . and shakespeare is hot
negative	one of the worst movies i've seen this year . pathetic . weak story , weak script , dull characters even though rufus sewell is pretty convincing : he was so hateful i wanted to strangle him . anyway , the sfx are ridiculous , i laughed out loud . it isn't scary at all . . . . sometimes the little girl was quite cool , but it's not enough .
negative	where in the hell is the original haunting on this list ? they have the remake , but not the original ? anyone who prefers this junk instead of the original cannot be called a horror film fan . plain and simple .
positive	i just need to know if erin brockovich ever married george ? i noticed that her name is now erin brockovich-ellis . but , it never tells us anywhere in the movie , or in the credits , what george's last name is .
positive	i didnt think a sequel of a kids movie could outshine the first and this one did . i hope theres a 3
positive	i didn't want to see this movie because nicole kidman sang and acted in it , which i believed that she could do neither . well she has come such a long way since her earlier days of being mrs . tom cruise . she not only held her own , but she had a pleasant singing voice and carried off the part quite well . i like the turn of the century setting with the modern music . the dance sequences were deftly executed and well placed . we started off with the liveliness and joviality of the can can and moved on to the dark , and sexy tango , which tells a story within a story . there was definately lots of eye-candy , but there was solid acting to back it up from all sides . although the basic plot was far from original , ( boy meets girl , etc ) , it was the strenght of the actors who took it far . the tragic ending was very powerful because of mcgregors performance . you felt his pain . if you have to see any of baz lurhman's movies , see this one and spare yourself the pain of the velvet goldmine ( also starring mcgregor ) .
positive	i first saw it in 1948 . i guess you gotta give it a 5 , but how that wimp , ashley , could resist scarlett is beyond me . thomas mitchell is really great in this flick .
positive	i liked the movie because it was a great adventure ! every minute is good , especially when he finds the holy grail .
negative	it seems times not the only thing this film ran out of
positive	this is a great family movie that has everything villians , heroes , and the girl that needs rescued . why i gave it 5 was that it was believable . imagine any of you finding something like that and do you think you could do any better ?
negative	oh my ! everyone says it's such a good movie . i found it plain boring . plus , i didn't understand the meaning . what is the ending supposed to mean ? please someone explain it to me , it seems i'm to dumb to understand .
positive	first class , toungue-in-cheek suspense thriller by the greatest filmmaker of all time ! north by northwest does not deserve to be this low on the list at all ! i would think that such an entertaining movie would top the list !
positive	i think this movie is really cute and touching . the friendship between them was really beautiful .
positive	a sci-fi movie with a message - when sci-fi flicks weren't supposed to have messages . . .
positive	genius ! a very quotable and very funny movie .
positive	the truth is a breath of fresh air , in a liberal lies ifested environment . great docomentary ! ! !
positive	good love story ala romeo juliette , some special effect a little overdone , but still good , interesting plot , therefore will not appeal to total some blood and gore fanatics . good acting and story flow . music fit well . not a movie for small children .
positive	couldn't get any better !
positive	alright , alright , alright ! i think if i hear one more person say that tomas hewitt or leatherface was real , or that this excellent movie was based on some maniac in texas i am gonna go on a chainsaw wielding massacre myself . here s the low down , kids texas chainsaw massacre , psycho , and a dozen other of our favorite horror movies are almost purely ed gein . don t believe me ? you don t have to read the excellent book deviant , which chronicles ed gein s ghastly deeds , and not to be a jerk aurielle , but it was never , ever proven that ed gein ate any of his victims in any way shape or form , he did however , wear their skin , just like our huge buddy leatherface ( but you are right about him only actually killing two people . the dozens of others were already dead ) . the texas chainsaw massacre is purely imagination mixed with headlines taken from ed gein stories . but don t take my word for it i dare you to find a single newspaper clipping or report of some crazed mass murderer from texas chopping up anyone in the last 60 years . however , it s very easy to find loads of information on ed gein , and even more info on how his disgusting acts turned into pop fiction horror movies . that fact alone is enough for me . i m not saying it s impossible that some nut hacked up some kids with a chainsaw in texas , but if it happened , this movie sure as hell ain t based on it . and the whole based on a true story thing ? it s a marketing tool , guys . if the kids think this stuff really happened , maybe it ll fill more seats in the theaters , and oh look , it usually does . but anyway , in closing , i loved this movie and although i didn t find it the least bit scary , i did find it disturbing , moving , and even sad ( the engagement ring thing . . . ouch . . . ) which is better in my opinion . the ending seemed very abrupt and left me with some unresolved tensions , but all in all , it was terrific . but the really scary thing was how ungodly beautiful jessica biel looked in those blue jeans and that cowboy hat . who s with me ?
positive	i don't think it can be noted for a great deal of cinematic brilliance , but it is nonetheless a favorite among people around my age ( 13-19 ) . i must have seen it 35 times . kids just love seeing the idea of a 10-year-old outsmarting two criminal bandits . the physical abuse they endure at the hands of kevin mccallister is the extremely humorous part . also , everyone has been angry at their family and felt left out at one point or another ; but it teaches that you have to look past that and be with your family ( especially during the holiday season ) .
positive	a very scary movie . this is one of the only movies that truly scares me . you have these people trapped out in space , out in the middle of nowhere , with this alien who's menacing and frightening look is only matched by its killer instinct .
positive	i really liked the active involment with the children . the songs were easy and fun to sing to . even when i was younger i sang along with julia .
positive	true holiday classic . it does seem a little old fashioned compared to today's films , but that's also part of its charm .
positive	favor movie ever love it love it love it !
negative	one of the crappiest musicals of all time . based on a totally trivial premise , i . e . , the life of a notorious striptease artist , the only redeeming feature of the story is that it provided a view of that time in american entertainment history when vaudeville faded ( for good reason ) and the first tame steps toward salacious fare surfaced . the songs are terrible . rosalind russell overacts , oversings , overemotes and shouts her way straight through this turkey : instead of coming across as a memorable and remarkable woman , her performance is a flop-sweat approximation of a shrill , pushy , obnoxious , proud , vain , self-centered would-be martyr menopausal biddy . enough to make you puke . natalie wood , usually a fine actress , is miscast in this one , and as a result , isn't too convincing . karl malden puts in his typical stolid , measured workmanlike role , and as such , puts in the best performance . it's a wonder they did a remake of this carwreck : maybe they figured that for once , they could top the original . it wouldn't be difficult . but i hear the remake sucked too . can't make chicken salad out of tuna salad . . .
positive	i can give this movie high ratings because it had a good plot and i liked the whole movie but i thought it was going to be scary . it wasn't . but this is a must see . very good acting done by kim basinger and the little girl .
positive	great movie with some wonderful talented actors . danny glover , whoopi goldberg and oprah winfrey was a natural . the best part was when whoopis character finally stood up to that mean husband of hers . you could only cheer her on as she got stronger
positive	i enjoyed it .
negative	no way should this have beaten traffic for best movie .
negative	like all kubrick films , this movie is completely useless .
positive	one of the greatest concepts in music history . all the credit to pink floyd ( especially roger waters ) for coming up with such an amazing album . from that album , came a blockbuster movie . when i think of allan parker , fame , commitments may come in mind to some . however , this movie outdoes them all as far as parker's directing skills go . truly one for the ages .
negative	will ferrell is one of the worst actors to ever come out of snl , and this movie proves this once again . the script of this movie proves to be very lame , and i did not find one scene remotely funny .
positive	words fail me . i saw this film for the first time , today and i cannot even begin to tell you how absolutely stunning it is . francis ford coppola has gained my vote as one of cinema's greatest filmmakers . the godfather part i and ii are his greatest achievements , but apocalypse now is a tour de force of a movie .
positive	ohhhhh my gosh ! this was such a great movie ! jennifer lopez was really good in it . it was really romantic , yet funny . if you haven't seen it yet , do it now ! ! it was sooooo good !
negative	boring just because for its time it had good camera angles this made on # 1 on the top 100 best films of all time .
positive	top gun was the best fighter movie ever made . the soundtrack to it makes you get an adrenaline rush . the fighter pilots make you feel like you are in the sky .
positive	gilliam's best film . thank god for cable tv in the late '80's , failing it i would not have been able to see this movie like six times , which i needed to finally get my head around it .
positive	don't . . . put . . . the candle . . . back still one of the funnies movies i've ever seen .
positive	a very dark comedy from the early days of films . cary grant provides all the laughs you can supply him with , and the rest of the cast is superb in their supporting roles . the way they make fun of the whole idea of killing people is almost scary . definitely see this masterpiece .
positive	i loved this movie , not only was it filled with the comic greatness that the screenplay provided but it was well acted and indeed deserved that oscar .
positive	very entertaining !
positive	i loved this cute , funny , adventurous movie . the first one as well is one of my favorite family films . i think my favorite character this time around was puss-n-boots ! what a riot he was . one of the best scenes was when he made that cute helpless face where his eyes got all big and he put his ears back . lol the whole audience said awwwwwww . . . when he did that . antonio banderas was really good as his voice . the fairy godmother was intriguing too . i was really amazed at how realistic their facial expressions were , especially hers . and that arrogant prince charming was alright . donkey was his usual self . this was cute . . . ; - )
positive	aliens was by far the best of the alien series . it showed more aliens was more gruesome than the others . it was truly a thriller !
positive	nick park and his powers of imagination is an inspiration to us all . thank goodness there are still people who believe in using their minds and reaching for the highest point of comedy instead of the lowest . sure , chicken run isn't for everyone , but my kids love it and i did and it was nice to watch something together and laugh and have fun .
negative	you couldn't pay me to see this crap
negative	i joyfully pass on all the potter garbage , books and movies .
negative	horrible remake of a kids cartoon that needed no such treatment . it expanded the 'grinch' universe . it just speaks to the arrogance of hollywood . the notion that they could do something like this is appaulling that did not need doing either . jim carrey plays him ok , but not what it should have been . they should learn from their mistakes and not do things like this . twenty-two minutes is just right for the dr . seuss classic .
positive	
positive	you know , when you don't have the toilet paper throwing and screaming , and can actually hear the lines , you discover that there's actually some very clever satire that plays on old science fiction and horror movies . sort of an early ms3000 type humor put into a film rather than beside it . and the songs always ring through my head , especially the half naked susan sarandan singing " touchatouchatouchatouchatouch meee . . . . " well , the image anyway .
negative	a movie for geriatrics . old people who get a renewed vigor due to sucking the life force of a couple of unhatched aliens . this is supposed to be an uplifting film ? probably the biggest and worst oversight is that with all the renewed vigor , they still have thin , old , disgusting bodies they you to frolic with . gross !
positive	i love to dance and i found this movie very good at showing the effort to learn to dance . i also really have wanted to see an actually take of a cuban mambo . im not quite sure it was entirely correct but it was pretty close .
positive	c'mon . see it with your kids . i did . they laughed all the way through it and i must say , it was contagious . for those complaining about wasting their 7 bucks or walking out of the theatre . . . i hope you have a miserable time camping out waiting for the new star wars movie to open . you buncha goofy goobers ! !
positive	awsome plot funny , makes you crie its great
negative	incredibly stupid movie . i can't believe anyone would pay to see this , let alone believe anyone would get paid to make crap like this . about fifteen minutes was all i could take . usually i can make myself sit through a movie like this , but even i have my limits . complete waste of time .
positive	robin williams is an overactor , but he does it w / such great ease . but , he was the ugliest woman that i have ever seen except for patrick swayze , wesley snipes and john leguizamo in to wong foo . . .
positive	this is one of my favourite movies . i've seen it a million times and i never get sick of it . all of the actors in this movie do a great job and the movie keeps your attention all the way through . definitely worth seeing .
positive	one of my favorite movies of all time . de nero plays a convincing intimidating dad ( wouldn't you be ? ) , and ben stiller plays a great goofball who only wants to do the right thing .
positive	the best disney movie ever . i never laughed that hard in a movie . dori is just hilarious . ellen degeneres did an outstanding job . i hope that they'll do a second one . this is not just a movie for kids , it is for the whole family . and i usually don't care for disney movies .
negative	this is one of the most irritating movie ever . i think jim carrey need not to act crazy and get the attention of all viewers .
positive	the only funny matthew broderick movie i've ever seen .
positive	naturalistic and suspensefull as hell . john boorman's one great movie , as far as i know . stellar work from john voight , ned beatty and burt reynolds , of all things .
negative	really , really bad film . the older it gets the dumber it seems .
positive	one of my favorite films . this is truly a haunting masterpiece . kubrick ended his career triumphantly . i think it is intense and dreamlike , and i liked the use of unique lighting . the movie was exceptionally unsettling , and i liked the direction and setting , although slowly paced .
positive	real horror , especially since this is the type of situation that really could happen . kathy bates is brilliant as an insane and obsessed fan from hell in this well made film . it is also noteworthy for the role-reversal of the usual psyhco / victim genders .
positive	chilling and totally mesmering film offers top-notch performers , and the best cinemotography in years . kudos to jodie foster for the most melodramatic , but likable performance of the year .
positive	awesome movie . outstanding vocal preformance by john goodman and david spade . very funny . good for all ages . it was type funny son .
positive	whatever john malkovich is in always turns out great . shadow of the vampire isn't your everyday giant budget jump out of your pants horror flick . shadow of the vampire takes you behind the making of nosferateu . of course nosferateu is played by william dafoe who believe it or not should get nominated for an oscar . i have seen so many vampire movies and horror movies having to do with vampires but you really got into his character . he did an excellent job portraying a dark figure with a little of comedy . in the shadow of the vampire malkovich again hits us with a brillant performance in which he plays the director of the original movie nosferateu . when the movie ends you don't know weather to love him or hate him . excellent movie . search down a theatre to find where it plays because its definetly a movie all people must see if you appreciate excellent acting .
positive	this movie perhaps was good to me because of my interest in the special population ( ie those with disorders / handicaps or disabilities ) . i work w / autistic individuals and the movie was an excellent portrayal of what these people are like .
positive	i enjoyed this flick , but i realize that it was not exactly historical . i enjoy it for the spirit of nationalism that it helped contribute to the scots . king edward was a fright and i think he is portrayed quite accurately . the defenestration scene of his son's advisor is priceless .
positive	cameron's first masterpiece , proved that he was a likely contender with already-appreciated directors like spielberg or scorsese . the man made arnold the star that he is . and , made several more unforgettable classics along side the superstar . why-o-why can't cameron and arnold get together to do true lies 2 ? i know that terminator 3 can't add up to it's predecessors without these two icons of film . terminator , the original has impressive effects given it's 6 million dollar budget , and for the times in which it was made . they didn't have the matrix effects yet ( sarcastic ) . but , you people have to realize cameron revolutionize effects enough so that they could actually make the matrix . action , like most of cameron movies is relentless and intense . . . as it should be . comedy , subtle but all also can be sinister . romance and nudity , as most of these kind of movies should have ( which adds to the story instead of dipletes the integrity ) . this is the model for every action picture since , that i've seen at least .
positive	the atmosphere and the music is so inspiring . with the brilliant acting the one that started the whole slasher genre and terrifying music .
positive	best film of the trilogy . this has a great story . although unoriginal now it has the greatest twist of all the films - arnold is the good guy .
positive	gone with the wind depicts a bygone era of grace and charm of the old south . while the love story was intermixed with the civil war , it shows how women had to be strong to survive . scarlette was the epitomy of all the grace , charm and slyness of women back then . her devilish charm won many hearts and i wish for a short time . . . we could all experience that period of time .
positive	epic . great story . viggo mortenson and omar sharif are fantastic . go see it .
positive	love this movie ! ! ! while it definitely takes a serious slant on history , it is fun to watch .
positive	adam sandler is hilarious and i loved this movie ! my favorite scenes have to be when he was singing into the intercom that went to the outside of his apartment i wanna kiss you all over and the old chinese lady came up and you think that is funny but then they show him running out the next morning and she is wearing his shirt and says hey you don't want breakfast ? ! then you think gross ! also when he sends his grandmother to a retirement home and ben stiller plays the man in charge of the retirement home and he makes the grandmother's sew quilts so he can sell them ! ! !
positive	oh my god i grew up with this movie
positive	what can i say about this movie that hasn't been said already ? it's an absolutely brilliant film , and everyone that took a part in making it should be praised and applauded .
positive	i thought this movie was great . i liked the whole movie . i didn't fall asleep once .
positive	a great movie . probably the funniest i have ever seen . i love the coconut bit and the french taunting . your mother was a hamster , and your father smelt of elderberries !
negative	video games should never be made into movies . look at super mario brothers .
positive	i loved this movie . all the references to past movies and cameos made it really funny and interesting for me .
positive	a great movie to watch over and over !
negative	what an overrated film !
positive	this movie is hardcore . heads were blown off , zombies were blown up and they shot a baby in the face . and its all topped off with some frontal nudity . it is the greatest zombie related movie ever . its what resident evil should have been .
positive	of all the lotr movies , i wouold have to say this one is my favorite . if i can sit through this movies 5 times and not get tired of it , you know i must love it . and it's not just because of orlando's eye shot closeup in fangorn forest . although that did keep me on the edge of my seat for about 5 minutes afterwards . ( that was when i was obsessed with him , which i'm not anymore by the way ) this one definetly has the best battle scene . the batle at helms deep is amazingly crafted . it took them a long time to build that set . i think they said about 7 months . and then it gets destroyed ! talk about hard work gone before your eyes ! but it's all worth it . my favorite 2 lines from the battle scene . 1st , from legolas talking to gimli when he can't see . gimliwhat's happening ? legolasshall i describe it to you , or would you like me to find you a box ? . my second favorite , again from gimli and legolas . when their fighting the orcs and such , gimli leoglas ! two already ! leoglas i'm on 17 ! gimli argh ! i'll have no pointy ear outscoring me ! legolas19 ! it's hilarious ! ya , i know , i'm a die-hard fan !
negative	boring homosexual promotion .
positive	excellent stuff . tarantino should take tips from this on how to make a quality action thriller . top performances all around . as for the comment from jerricabenton . . . yeah . . sure you had it all figured out ! !
positive	i saw this here movie just last night at one of them there dollar theaturs in my town and i got to say i think it was just a great movie . i am a big big fan of david duchovny so i was real excited to see him in this movie . and it is so funny . and it is just real intennse . and i liked it so much and cant even wate to get this movie on video . i aslo liked the make 7up yours guy that was in the movie . the aliens were kind of scarey but not nearly as scarey as the ones i seen in real life back in 98 .
positive	traffic was amazing ! ! ! ! ! the peoplw who you thought couldn't act , surprise , they can . michael douglas is my hero . i loved this movie it was pure genious . and anyone who trys to compare this movie to the general's daughter , will have to deal with me . if you havent seen it go see it . i am in love with traffic .
negative	stupid !
positive	classic , classic , classic . gene kelly was just wonderful in this movie . something about him in this movie is just so charasmatic and really draws you into the story of the movie . perhaps the best scene was of gene kelly tapping and singing down the street in the rain . it's one of those scenes you never forget and always makes you smile . all of the dancing and singing was great , and donald o'connor was hilarious , as usual . the chemistry between reynolds and kelly was real and not forced which just made their performances that much better . but best of all , this musical actually had a plot . a real , substantial plot . from a musical , can you imagine .
negative	just see the first one . the other two are like a bunch of saturday night live sketches lumped together and dragged out as much as humanly possible . the biggest laugh was when ozzy osborne was shown , just for how dated the movie will be in a few years . the first one was funny and original , they should have just left it alone after that .
positive	this story has a moral to it , sf veterans should not be messed around with . sly was awesome and the town got totally f'd up , that sherif was a prick , and trautmans uniform was all wrong . but oh well i didnt catch it the fist few times .
negative	'clueless' . . . how appropriate . . . seems the producers knew it from the beginning . . . any you airheads rating this movie great : of 10 million sperm , you were the faster ? ? ? ?
negative	although the thought of passengers in space is cool , the film is boring , tedious and just plain unimaginative . compared to the brilliance found in the various star trek incarnations , 2001 seems grounded in a sort of reality . also , long portions of the film drag on without any humor , action , or dialogue . i just can't watch this film without getting sleepy .
positive	this movie is great for many reasons . many of the things that make this movie great don't stand out very well by today's standards . but , if you look at the time it was made , this movie truly shines . first , one of the main characters is black . he is one of the heroes of the movie . and this is in a movie with one of the greatest actors of the era , humphrey bogart . also , other than sam , the intentions of the other characters are all rather ambiguous . one moment you'll see bogie handing his friend over to the nazis , next he's smuggling polish rebels to american . the good guys aren't so good , the bad guys aren't so bad , and some you just can't tell . there were no shining heroes or slimy villians , just the gray that occupies the large space between them . in an era where all the heroes had to be pure , this movie went against the grain .
positive	i seen this movie this afternoon . and itr was worth every penny .
positive	i saw this movie a little while ago and it's hella good . you never know what's going to happen . it had shocking and off guard parts . i think this movie is worth seeing twice .
positive	i love this movie . there are few more satisfying plots than that of a wrongfully accused person who is vindicated and earns the respect of the hard-nosed cop trying to chase him down . the performances were all great , and the dialogue possessed a gritty real-life quality i found refreshing . one minor irritant : it is of course absurd that ford would wait until after being convicted to track down the one-arm man via his mechanical arm . not that he had to bother : the movie revealed that chicago pd interviewed the murderer during their initial investigation . all they would have had to do is show ford his picture and he would have identified him ( the craggy-faced man only disguised himself with a wig for heaven's sake ) . ( i also wonder how the murderer got 13 people to verify he was out of town when he wasn't , but no matter . ) also , since the lack of forced entry into the apartment was a big issue , the first question someone would have asked was if somebody might have had a key . bingo -- dr . nichols borrowed the car , even phoned the murderer from it . oh well . if they had been so logical we wouldn't have had a gripping , highly entertaining movie . that would been a far bigger irritant .
positive	an intelligent film not really a horror film rather more of a thriller with alot of suspense thrown in . still it manages to scare you on a thinking level . pretty good preformances . i've only just seen this film less than a year ago and really enjoyed it . loved the brit eklund dancing scene very arousing especially if consider it from the constable's point of view with all his repression and such . nicely done scene .
negative	www . fear . com / sucksbigmonkeynuts . html
positive	a beauty of a film . acting first class and spacey is terrific from start to finish . his mentor jack lemmon would be proud . directing is superb from debutant mendes . music brilliant .
positive	great series . one of my all time favorites as a kid . good music . hella scary story . everyone was good . acting was good . all time classic horror movie .
positive	tom hanks is great as a lawyer who has aids he hides it as long as he can until the symptoms become more obvious , when his lawfirm finds out they fire him . he hires a lawyer well played by denzel washington to defend him . shows the prejudice and ignorance those have against people who have aids . very well done movie . and a tear jerker at times .
positive	i think it is a totally awesome movie ! alicia is great and i hav 2 give snaps 2 stacy an donald they were so funnyyo whats up u jeepin behind my back ? ha
negative	ignorance . anyone who wastes money even renting this movie should do a serious mental evaluation .
positive	a pleasant and welcome return of sam raimi to films dealing with the supernatural . this in my opinion was on of the best films of the year . with blistering good performances from an all star ensemble cast , this movie really packs a heavy punch . of course cate blanchette steals the show in an as always genious performance as a widowed mother of three young boys in southern alabama ( i think ) . she makes money by giving people readings . she gives these by using a deck of cards that have different symboles on the face side . she starts to have strange visions during the day and while she sleeps that there is some foul play going on in her little town . this film is propleeled by it's great performance , uncanny ability to keep the story up to speed and thought provoking and its beautiful directing by a true master , sam raimi . the cast includes such talents as greg kinnear , hillary swank , katie holmes , keanu reeves ( exibiting acting abilities that must have been hidden for all these years ) and the second best performance in the movie coming from a very under rated actor giovanni ribisi . his performance in this movie is captivating and very real . a well done , naturalistic murder mystery / supernatural thriller . highly highly recommended . if you like brilliant acting , story telling and great film making treat yourself to a very good little sleeper .
positive	it's a top , top , top , top notch movie ! !
positive	great movie ! it kept you laughing throughout the whole movie .
negative	bite my shiney metal arse .
positive	written and directed by sly stallone it provided an in depth look at the struggle of italians in the 80's . an epic movie that started the equally epic series .
positive	i loved this movie ever since i was a kid . i loved my bike too so i could relate to pee-wee .
negative	this movie is no even funny
positive	i'm going to show her my ohhh face . . . . ohhh , ohhh , ohhh
negative	with star wars , george lucas turned the film industry on its head . with phantom menace , george lucas joined the rest of the film industry in its superficial marketing-fest . phantom menace does not have the uncorrupted feel of ( the original 1977 version of ) star wars . episode i takes itself far too seriously . it has no wit , no great chemistry between the stars , and hardly any character development . the actors do very little to create sympathy . all that and barely enough plot to fill a midichlorian's left nostril . but what about all the great inside jokes ? i hear you whine . what about them ? if i want a bunch of gratuitous inside jokes , i'll watch the latest disney movie .
positive	kind of stupid but it defined a generation , funny , funny stuff . sandler's best work ! good movie
positive	it was soooo funny i saw it the first day it came out and then two days later !
positive	i love the storyline .
positive	not only is it a thriller , but it's also for families . my younger siblings loved it . great for families . just enough action , comedy and love story . almost a chick flick .
negative	rutger hauer is a cyborg warrior who helps earth fight for its existence in an apocalyptic scenario . avoid at all costs !
positive	plain out , great movie . i loved every aspect of it , and the acting was all very well done . johnny depp portrayed jack sparrow very well , as did orlnado bloom as will .
positive	in the mood for something truly disturbing tonight ? then you should check out the texas chainsaw massacre . tobe hooper's horror masterpeice , the texas chainsaw massacre is one of the most influential horror movies ever made . this is the story of 5 youth and there afternoon drive turning into a gory , hellish night of terror and murder . this is the movie that brought us leatherface , played by gunner hansen , one of the most intersting and well . . bad-ass characters ever imagined . so come with leatherface and his red-neck , cannibalistic family down to thier house for dinner , the main course , you ! and maybe you can play let-grampa-beat-you-in-the-head with a hammer and other fun party games brought to you by the family . i only wish i was around when this movie was in theatres . one of the most disturbing and oringinal horror movies ever made . this is the definition of raw horror . a milestone in horror movie history . this is a must see for any true horror fans out there .
positive	they are so funny ! they just crack me up everytime !
negative	ugh . what an amazing disappointment ! there's nothing worse than going to see a movie you expected was going to be good , and it all ends up blowing in your face like a bomb . i cannot believe i saw this completely crappy and pointless movie . i'm sorry if i'm being crude here , but it was just so disappointing to see leo make a fool out of himself . i paid 5 freaking bucks to 1 . ) have all my friends make a joke out of me for about a week ( because i was the one who made them go see it ) . 2 . ) have no one at all trust me when i would say hey , this movie looks good let's go see it ! ( no matter what movie i was reffering to ) . and 3 . ) have to sit for about 2 hours that seemed to be the longest of all my life , to discover i had just made a fool out of myself by actually dragging my friends along ( atleast if i wouldn't have , i would have been the only one suffering ) . the movie made me feel crappy and unwanted . can't describe it anymore ! it deserves a 0 . 1 , but the lowest was a 1 , so i'll just have to compromise !
negative	this movie was sooo stupid ! i dont like martin shean . this movie was nasty .
positive	it is definately a movie to watch with the family . i found it to be very entertaining and witty at times , and nicholas cage , as always gave an awesome performance . i really enjoyed watching cage's character change throughout the film , going from the rich snobbish playboy to the family man . it is definately one worth seeing .
positive	for good vs . evil , special effects and the cast , spiderman ii is tough to beat .
positive	rosemary's baby is terrific . mia farrow was great
positive	this movie was entirely misunderstood by a lot of critics and most of the public at large . i found it to be a brilliant experiment in acting and use of innovative camera techniques . it isn't a film for the uneducated masses who like hollywood slop delivered to them in neat little packages . it makes you ponder and listen carefully to what is being shown on screen . it is complex and multi-layered in its approach . the acting of david hyde pierce is exquisite and his character is definitely the heart of the piece . catherine keener and mary mccormick are also great in this film . steven soderburgh is one of the most talented directors in the business and full frontal will some day be recognised as the masterpiece it really is .
positive	this is an excellent movie about friendship . it's what you'd expect from stephen king . the soundtrack is simply perfect . probably the greatest soundtrack any movie could ever have .
positive	i thought this movie was awesome ! definitly matt's best character . i read the book and they are both great . the director did a great job telling the story !
negative	lmao at star wars . star wars sucks
positive	i thoroughly enjoyed this movie - in large part because of its uniqueness . i have not had the opportunity to see a lot of films from the martial arts genre , and i have to admit , i was not expecting the depth that this movie delivered . the cinematography was amazing , the gravity defying fight scenes were possibly the best that i have ever seen , and the characters were compelling . this movie delivers comedy , romance , and action in a very non-traditional way - i don't think you will be disappointed .
positive	again , steven spielberg has triumphed . he is a shockingly creative man , to take one war and create two masterpieces , emotionally charged , star-studded , brutally realistic , sparing no expense . this man makes beautiful movies . a wide range of people can enjoy and appreciate this movie--veterans of this war , veterans of any war , students studying wartime , children of veterans , adults who knew someone who knew someone who died in the war , etc . this movie epitomizes the unbelievable sacrifice made time and again by our countrymen to keep our country and this world free . this movie has the power to make young people of peacetime appreciate the turmoil of people their age in wartime . superbly acted , as spielberg makes sure all his films are , though damon's part is comparatively small , it is remarkably memorable , his fresh-faced youth almost painful to see amongst such rubble and conflict . as he speaks of better times with his dead brothers , it is heartbreaking . tom hanks , one of the acting greats of our time , delivers an oscar-worthy performance , and i believe he speaks to the nation when he tells private james ryan to earn it .
positive	at the very beginning of the picture the camera moves ( or appears to move ) through the trees and the changing perspective of the branches gives a 3-d effect . the sheer beauty of these images is breathtaking . then the characters are introduced . thumper's delicious southern accent and mannerisms , flower's modesty ( you can call me flower if you want to ) , and the antics of the minor characters - all combine in a rich mixture of images . and then there is the music - little april showers - a lovely musical arrangement and superbly sung . and all this without a mention so far of the tear-jerking plot . this wonderful film surely deserves its 5 stars .
negative	needs more asian male actors
positive	needs to be in the top 5 . hilarious movie . as a golf caddy i really can relate to the movie . this movie is timeless and the replay value is infinite . danny : i thought you said winning wasn't everything ? ty : me , no . you , do . danny : good grammer ty . -or- dangerfield : that kangaroo stole my ball !
positive	it was the scariest movie i ever saw . it had a totally original idea which still scares me to this day . very good cast as well . that old man was really creepy .
positive	a really great / funny movie . one of jim carrey's best . i highly recommend it .
positive	i gave this movie a five because the graphics were so cool . the part when he was climbing on the mountain in the beginning looked real . the martial art moves that tom cruise does is amazing .
positive	the scariest movie i've seen in a long time .
positive	this movie is more than great , it's genius . not so much spooky as funny this movie will keep you lauging . and the suprisingly catchy phrases of ash are great . basically a remake of the first evil dead , ash returns to the same cabin in the woods . one of my personal favorites . watch this with return of the living dead and a big donut .
positive	love sandra bullock
negative	unfortunately , jason didn't go to hell and this far gone series is still churning out senseless sequels .
positive	i really enjoyed this movie . mostly i enjoyed the well fleshed out characterizations . for instance , even when you really hated the father for being so abusive to billy or the brother for being so angry , once you have a chance to know their situation you still manage to have sympathy for them . and though billy is portrayed as a likeable kid , they didn t try to make him a perfect angel either which did nothing to turn you against him and had everything to do with making him believable . the cast was terrific from poor old grandma to billy s friend down the street . the only thing in the movie that did not seem to ring completely true was that billy became a star of the ballet regardless of the fact that most ballet dancers begin at around the age of 3 and billy but did not start taking lessons until he was nearly in his teens . but i guess the whole point was that this was a prodigal who beat the odds - and in more ways than one .
positive	a movie that makes you think . no formula here , excellent plot twist at the end . for those looking for the regular mix of gunplay and explosions , this movie won't disappoint .
positive	my favorite disney movie , along with lilo & stitch . i remember seeing it in theatres all the way back in december 2001 , it is hilarious !
positive	i loved this movie ! i found it original and fresh with marvelous actors like christian bale and a uniqur storyline .
positive	this movie is great for kids as well as adults . the mouse is great as an actor and character .
positive	written , directed and staring roman polanski , this nightmare will find the paranoia in any viewer
positive	this movie was so sad . i must have seen it at least ten times and i still cry . the music is good . i don't know if i would have been able to survive in that time period as a woman . whoopi did a fabulous job . this movie makes me hate men . it brings out a lot of emotions . very powerful .
negative	really butt awful . think of all the hungry poor people we could've fed with the money they spent on this turkey .
positive	i thought this movie was hilarious . anybody who is a fan of will ferrell's snl days will really enjoy this film .
positive	it may not have been historically accurate in every detail but this film did an excellent job in capturing the essence of a righteous cause and the valor and honesty of the great scottish hero william wallace . i have not been so completely moved , excited or entertained by a film in many years . mel gibson was at his very best portraying wallace as the strong , determined , kindhearted man and somewhat reluctant hero . it was thrilling to experience for the first time on the big screen and definitely a must have for my personal video collection . if you want to know more about the real william wallace , read john mackay s book ( william wallace brave heart ) . if you want to experience the pure excitement of both the myth and legend watch the future movie classic braveheart !
positive	one of my all time favorite movies . the end was my favorite part . it was the most realistic scene of someone going to heaven i ever saw . very emotional and very good .
positive	totally superb . filmmaking at its best . this movie totally deserves the oscar for picture of the year . anyone who thinks its boring have no good taste .
positive	this song always reminds me of my childhood .
positive	i grew up with this movie and for a child a sweet happy ending movie is just fine . as i grew up , i still appreciate what this movie taught me when the lord closes a door , somewhere he opens a window . as a true story made sweeter , it gives the viewer hope against our enemies .
positive	the quintessential clint eastwood movie . a great script , excellent direction and one of the all-time loathesome villians . the scene where the villain pays someone to beat him up is worth the price of the rental all by itself .
positive	i love this movie . sean penn and michelle pffifer are knockouts , and the screenplay is heartbreaking .
positive	rightly one of the scariest movies of all time . no other film instills fear and lonliness in the viewer like this picture . i nearly soiled myself when the alien's hand shot out of the wall or when it pops out of that guys chest .
positive	it's just a game , focker ! are you kidding me ? this was one hell of a funny movie . who gives a rats ass about the story , it's not the freaking godfather , you morons . it's a comedy , it's suppose to make you laugh and it sure as hell made me many times over .
positive	this movie is absolutely my favorite gangster movie . it's a great storyteller that doesn't lose you at all . it's a 2 1 / 2 hour movie that doesn't even feel like one because it keeps you in so much suspense . i love it . every actor played a vital role in this movie .
negative	never even consider renting this movie - it's terrible . harrison ford made a rare mistake and agreed to work with a terrible script and one of the most annoying actresses ever ( melanie griffith ) . actually , now that i think about it , he made the same mistake with 6 days , 7 nights . anyway , this movie is a joke and isn't even worth tearing apart .
negative	as if the first one wasn't bad enough .
positive	count on a ripping story . count of a first rate cast that brings the characters alive . count of beautiful locations that are feast for the eyes . count on solid and creative direction . count on the count of monte cristo .
positive	roman holiday is a harmless classic on the verge of being classified a comedy . it is the story of a princess who , unhappy with her present life , decides to try out the rest of the world . an excellent entertainer !
negative	this has to be the worst horror movie i've ever seen ! i wasn't scared once , i didn't care about any of the characters and the killer was laughable . i was just sitting there thinking : is this it ? is this considered to be one of the greatest ever ? when nothing nothing interesting ever happened . nope i'd rather watch the dentist 2 again .
positive	this was a very funny movie with a great cast . tommy lee jones and will smith worked great together . i thought the story was very original and the script was witty and good .
negative	more will smith drivel .
positive	an absolute must see movie ! the glory of cinema !
positive	the best movie ever made ! ! !
positive	one of the best films ever made . the technology used in filming was revolutionary at the time . beautiful performances by bogart and bergman . the film is well put together and enjoyable .
positive	i thought it was funny .
positive	when someone told me this was the best gangster film ever written i laughed in their face . once i watched it , my mouth literally hit the floor as i heard my laughter come back to haunt me in what i can only describe as a resounding i told you so . this film is near genius accompanied with perfect casting , clear settings and a now very familiar famous soundtrack this all aids a very detailed account of the corleone family , especially the don who serves as the main patriarch of the family he loves whilst trying to balance the criminal instinct inside . we don't get to see the real don corleone until the godfather part 2 - played brilliantly by robert deniro . definitely worth watching .
negative	yuck .
positive	very scary !
positive	i thought braveheart was great b / c it was full of action and the plot had accurate details about what was going on at that time
positive	i love this movie . it wasn't really horror , more like action . it made me wanna be a vampire .
negative	although the movie is nearly devoid of objectionable content ( aside from the occasional profanity ) , there are two things that absolutely destroy the movie . first , the songs are extremely grating and annoying . second , the sexism in this production is outrageous . no more is this obvious than the shockingly-inappropirate ending . the ending is completely different than the short story , pygmmalion , that this 1964 movie is based on . i just can't recommend this production .

positive	it amazes me people don't like this movie because it is stupid . what were you expecting when you watched a movie with bill murray , chevy chase , and rodney dangerfield , an intellectual genius of a comedy ? this movie was great , and i think very underrated in terms of all time comedies .
positive	colin farrell -- makes the hwole thing work : d
negative	i don't know why this movie was such a big hit , it was gay .
positive	better than the original . the fight scenes were awesome and the reapers werecreepy and origional . the reaper epidemic shows you what happens when you try to play god without getting too preachy like jurassic park .
negative	after just reading the book , i thought the movie deleted too many essential characters and left out too many important facts that would have explained things in the movie . the movie seemed out of kelter with the book in several spots , almost as if they had to put them in the movie but not in the order they were in the book . overall , the movie just plain sucked . the actress that played clarice starling was horrible . i think if joddie foster had played in it , her abilities would have been so much better . the entire movie seemed like a clinical manual void of the emotion and horror that fuled the first movie .
negative	you are joking right ? what kind of people watch this nonsense ? how do movies like this get the $ 20 , 000 that it cost to make ?
positive	scary and realistic . good graphics . a horror classic . story was good , and creepy from beginning to end .
positive	wow ! what an entertaining movie . i simply don't understand the people who don't like this movie , but i'll bet to a person they voted for clinton . it is a roughly accurate historical portrayal of oppressive english colonialism , and the heroic efforts that were undertaken by the oppressed ( scots ) . the violence was graphic , but certainly in line with the reality of that time . gibson did a great job on both sides of the camera . good mix of comedy ( irish character , stephen ) and romance . i can understand those who say that this movie isn't their cup of tea , but anyone who calls it a bad movie has other motives .
positive	well , they did it again . toy story 2 is just as enchanting and wonderful as the first with great one-liners , and is just brilliant . the animation makes it awesome as well . if you liked toy story , you'll like this . see it now . summary : the sequel to toy story is just as enchanting and wonderful .
positive	go see it !
positive	the booooommmmmm
positive	absolutely fantastic . i studied media at college and developed a taste for foreign films and i had read the critics reviews and it was outstanding . so i went to the cinema and watched . it totally grabbed my attention due to the camerawork and style . the part i love best is where she runs past particular people and you see snapshots of what happen to them in the future and it changes with every senario that happens to lola . i now have the film on dvd and i highly recommend it .
negative	what a piece of formulatic crap . this movie is just another example that hollywood has run out of ideas . it serves no purpose other that to have talentless actors showcase their bland personalities in a badly written script , and to highlight current rap music that no one will remember in 5 years ( except missy elliot ) . the dancing is nothing new , and the plot is overused . this will probably make some impact at the box office , but that just goes to show the intelligence of the movie going public . i know this isn't supposed to be art , but formula movies should show some effort to be unique and different
positive	i cannot remember laughing so hard from watching a movie in years ! this was a truly original romantic comedy . i recommend this movie to everyone !
positive	what a great movie this is . i haven't seen it in a long time , but i remember it being one creepy flick . . . two scenes in particular really scared me - the one where c . thomas howell looks out of the car he is riding in to see rutger hauer riding in a station wagon with a family , with kids sitting on his lap . . . you just know that something terrible is going to happen . the most memorable scene from the movie may have been c . thomas howell getting an order of fries at the diner only to find . . . . well , i won't give it away . very scary , very well done movie .
positive	the first time i saw it , it freaked me out !
positive	i can't belive that nobody gave this 5 stars this movie is awesome ! ! lon chaney gave a great performance ! it was one of the best performances ever given ! ! i love this movie and i've watched it several times , it never gets old it's so fun to watch lon chaney as the phantom ! and i like the setting of the movie , the paris opera is beautiful ! it's a great flim ! it deserves 5 stars ! lon chaney is one of the greatest actors that ever lived !
negative	third-rate remake of a truly great original movie . tom hanks put in his usual unconvincing performance , and in this case , that bogus southern accent he tortured the audience with was really annoying . crass , broad , vulgar attempt at humor . peter sellers and alec guinness must be thrashing about wildly in their tombs .
positive	everyone loves the italian stallion . it is a great story of how the underdog can rise up and become the champion of the world , even beating mr . t and the russian .
negative	it's time to bury jason once & for all . and this time don't resurrect him . i'd rather stick my head in a grabage can and inhale deeply than sit through another movie like this . cheesy , cheap & pointless . we have the usual nearly naked girls , some teasing throw in with the slicing and dicing by jason . i know it's a free country , but we ought to consider a law banning sequels like this .
positive	i went to dr on vacation , and when i went to my room , i turned on the tv and refused to face the 80 degree temperature until this movie was over .
negative	what a joke . this was the stupidest movie with the worst music . clooney is good at picking the worst movies to act in .
positive	it's stanley kubrik's best film
positive	a lot of people will tell you this is the greatest movie ever made -- for once they're right . i won't attempt to dissect the film , others have done that far better than i could . i will only state that it is a great story that could not have been told in a more brilliant or insightful manner . some people will see this and simply not understand it . for them , i truly feel sorry . this is a masterpiece .
positive	five stars ? surely you can't be serious . i am serious . and stop calling me shirley . one of those movies that's so painful , it's good .
positive	even when i see natalie portman in films such as star wars ii , i still think of her as an execeptionally sweet little girl in 'leon' . directed by luc besson , starring the above natalie , jean reno , gary oldman . this is a story of mathilda who is orphaned by twisted cop gary oldman who kills his family because of some missing cocaine that her father was taking care of . mathilda is taken in by leon and a beautiful relationship between the two characters grow . leon is a hitman who is extremely childlike and simple . he kills without thinking , but takes great care in looking after his pot plant . mathilda wants to become a 'cleaner' like leon so she can revenge her little brothers death - but ends up in trouble herself and leon saves her . i won't ruin it for you by telling you exactly what happens - you'll have to watch it yourself . this is a beautiful simple film - quite timeless .
positive	great movie ! very funny and a unique topic . not stupid funny the way a lot of movies are trying to be . quality humor .
positive	little funny parts in it , but i give this one a 5 star becuase its just a movie you can watch 3 billion times and still enjoy it .
negative	almost as funny as final destination . this is one of those movies that make you think don't people bleed after getting stabbed ? . if you're one of those people that think this was a worthless piece of crap . than i'm proud to say that you're smarter than the jack ass that made the movie .
positive	i loved this movie , cute and funny . ashley judd & hugh jackman had great chemistry . . .
positive	the sleekiest of film noirs and deliciously twisted all the way to the end , an excellent mystery . gene tierney ( laura ) is beautiful .
positive	this movie is hilarious . i love the outbursts by robin williams . bastard son of barney . you illegenament telli-tubbey .
positive	seldom has such a powerhouse of acting talent been assembled and what a film ! this is a sensitive and emotive subject and needs to be handled professionally and with respect . stanley kramer skillfully draws first rate performances from his 'a' list cast . he avoids sentimentality or traditional 'hollywoodisms' , creating an atmosphere so real that we feel that we are observers in a genuine court room . the graphic footage , actually taken at the liberation of some of the camps , only serves to make this film more harrowing and yet effective . kramer has been brilliant in his casting . the solid judge spencer tracy is authoritive , whilst having wrestle with his own personal feelings . maxamillian schell is effective as the young attorney , ambitious and yet misguided in his loyalties . montgomery clift , a tortured soul in real life , uses his own deamons to brilliant effect as the simpleton , who has been subjected to steriliztion . the stand-out however is judy garland , as the hausfrau falsely accused of intimacey with a jew . garland proves , in her short sequences , that she is very much an equal in the acting game as she is a legendary musical star . that she , for the second time in her career was not awarded the oscar , for which she was nominated , is one of the greatest oversights in the history of the academy . she acts with her very soul . the only peice of miscasting in my mind is burt lancaster . whilst he is , as always , professional . his performance as an accused german judge does not quite gel . altogether though , a brave and risky film which really pays off .
positive	great music movie ! it includes everthing , adventure , romance and some tragedy . this is a complete movie with fine songs that are unforgettable , i do somtimes sing " so long , farewell " when it is a formal parting . truly one great true story with a lot of realism- i couldn't tell if the background hills are really a backdrop of austria or just made up . one of the best movies these actors participated in . ( esp . for julie andrews , this should be the best . )
positive	that is one of the best suspense movie i ever saw !
positive	with me working at my local cinema , i must say that this film has been the most enjoyable one to view . i first thought that this , as a musical , would be dry and only apealing to the fans who had seen the west-end verison , but i was proved wrong as the whole film was extreamly entertaining ! the plot wasnt outstanding but the singing and acting abilties of the performers was brilliant . the bright and up-beat songs kept the whole audience in awe and the costumes were just perfect . i personaly love this movie . . . its definatly one to sing along to ! it isnt for the younger audience but for teen-agers and above its a great film to watch and is a much wanted release from the serious and dominating movies this year .
positive	mike myers is the man
positive	people called romans , they are going to house
positive	simply put , an amazing movie , probably one of the best sci-fi film , hell best film of the last decade . it gives a shocking and very plausible look at the not too distant future where people can genetically engineer their own children . vincent , played by a very capable ethan hawke , is one of those who are not genetically engineered . he was born out of love , without the tinkering of scientists and their genetic manipulation . not trying to quickly summarize the movie in a sentence or two ( simply because you can't since the movie's that powerful ) . . . but basically the rest of the movie is about his pursuit of his dream of becoming an astronaut at the space corporation gattaca . the movie , while a bit slow at places , is an emotional and incredible ride that shows us the meaning of what it is to be human and that we can all achieve what we aspire . the music , composed by michael nyman is one of those musical scores that can stand on its own without the movie , though it definitely enhances the already great writing and strong performances by ethan hawke , uma thurman among others . this is one of those movies have had profound impact on me . if you haven't seen it , you should go out and rent it immediately . hell , even if you have seen it , you should go out and rent it immediately as well ! you will not be disappointed .
negative	ahhhhhhh ! oh my god ! ! this movie scared the crap outta me ! ! i couldn't sleep because of the stupid , creepy clown that clown was so so freaky and scary i was extremly scared oh my gosh everytime i see that movie in the store i scream for real ! !
positive	brilliant ! . . . from the beginning to the superlative ending . m . knight's greatest success and his greatest failure , cuz now , everything he makes will be judged by the standard he set for himself in this movie .
positive	this is one of my favorite movies of all time . it started off my zombie craze . the newer version of dawn of the dead may have more action and special effects , but it lacks the awesome mood and environment present in the original , as well as its underlying message . the characters in the original are also better developed in my opinion , and there is great dark humor present in this original version as well . the theatrical release is great , but if you can , get the director's cut , because it sets the movie up better , and includes some scenes that seem sort of integral to the film once you have seen both the theatrical and director's cut releases . the newer version was exciting and well-done ; i like it , too , but the original can't be beat . george a . romero made a masterpiece when he made dawn of the dead .
positive	very good original story done all with computers . i just loved this movie about toys that come to life when the humans are not around . woody is a toy cowboy who is devoted to his kid andy . woody is andy's favorite toy until buzz lightyear comes and now woody feels he has lost andy . woody wants to get rid of buzz . this only backfires and both end up at sids a boy who loves to destroy toys . now they must work together to get away from sid and back to andy who will be moving away . this is a family movie all ages can enjoy . we all loved the movie and found it to be very funny and entertaining . there are some good actors providing the voices such as tom hanks and tim allen .
positive	before i saw this movie , i did not care for ashton kutcher . i thought he was silly and boring . but when i watched this movie , he amazed me ! he has such good acting range ! his character made me smile and cry . this is a truly well constructed film with an original tale . no other time travel film can top the butterfly effect , not even future sci-fi films can aspire to these standards !
positive	one of the best ! ! !
positive	while the chances of it happening are probably nill , it's a cool movie . there are lots of twists in the plot and it really makes you think about how one tiny little decision or act in the past could drastically change the future . it's definitely worth seeing .
positive	cowabunga ! ! ! ! ! one of the greatest films from my youth . i will stand by the turtles till the day i die . i love being a turtle ! ! ! ! ! !
positive	the movie that started it all . what can be said that has not been said already about this movie ? it is undeniably the best modern mafia movie ever made , and is briliantly adapted from mario puzo's book . al pacino and marlon brando play their parts exquisitely . if you haven't seen this already , you should .
positive	oh my goodness , i loved this movie . i was skeptical at first because film just doesn't have the same spark as a live broadway show but this totally blew me away . its beautiful to watch and emmy rossum , who plays christine , is fantastic . she has a true talent .
positive	i could watch this over and over , and i do ! ! ! ! ! yes , a little long , and some of the scenes are probably not neccassary , like the scene towards the end of him running to san francisco and back ? what was that all about ?
negative	tom hank's worst !
positive	i love quentin tarantino . nobody knows how to write a plot like him . i love how the story is told from different points of view and the plot is like a puzzle which slowly fits to create a thrilling climax . there are great twists at the end . wonderful movie .
positive	in my opinion , the greatest sci-fi remake . . . the ending is superb .
positive	a really pleasantly surprising movie , i enjoyed it even much more than i anticipated ! now i am looking forward to the 2nd legally blonde !
negative	really stupid .
positive	there are many great war films out there , but apocalypse now is certainly the greatest of them all . although , technically not a war film , it deals with thoughts and ideas that could only be conjurred in the act of war , thus i classify it as such . this film showcases francis ford coppola's director skills , even more so than his godfather films ( although that is endlessly arguable ) .
negative	i do not know what led me to believe this would be a comedy but i was truly disappointed when i quickly found that it wasn t . i was further disappointed that the entire story was depressing , pointless and had an ugly edginess to it . drew barrymore did not convince me that she was this woman at the age of 15 , 36 or anything in between . she further failed to convince me that her character was deserving of my sympathy or respect . half the time i wanted to slap some sense into her and the other half i simply lost interest in her self-involved mindset . she set herself up , she fell and then she proceeded to whine and blame everyone around her . i kept wanting to say if you re as smart as you think you are and if college and career are so important to you then get off your butt , get a part-time job , a student loan and go for it you know , join the rest of the real world . were we really supposed to feel sorry for this self-interested idiot who ignores her child and proceeds to dry pot in the oven of her government subsidized shack for some quick cash ? apparently no more than we were meant to enjoy this dreadful tale of woe .
positive	this movie takes everything that is considered taboo or nasty and shows people that stuff like that really can happen . by the end of the movie , you are definitely left w / this weird feeling , like you wish things hadn't been so bad for the neighbor , you wish spacey's character hadn't gotten shot . . . what a good movie .
positive	jack nicholson is crude but brilliant . this movie is more subtle than knee slapping or gut busting comedies . even though you hate jack's character , you've got to love him , too . helen hunt and greg kinnear are both fantastic , as is that cute little dog .
negative	a stupid movie by fellini , must have a thing about large breasts ? ? ? ? . . . .
positive	a visual masterpiece . many of the actors smoked weed and dropped acid in order to really get into their roles . this movie has a gritty , surealistic feel that definitely benefits from the sacrifices and passion of francis ford coppolla .
positive	i absolutely love this movie . treat williams was definitely the star of the show . the soundtrack is excellent . i love when he dances on the table and sings i got life . i've been watching this movie ever since i was little . to my fathers horror i used to sing some of the racier songs out loud ( i had no idea what those words meant ) . berger is a great character , and i never fail to cry at the end every time .
positive	scotty doesn't know .
negative	this movie is absolutely awful . it deserves no stars . truly , it sucks !
positive	5 stars , but a reserved 5 stars . an excellent movie that was also incredibly offensive and revolting at the same time . why , you ask ? the depictions of the lows of human nature which the characters enter are 100 % revolting and disgusting . if you have a weak stomach , are opposed to depictions of sex , violence , drug abuse , etc . , by all means do not watch this movie . for those who can appreciate the extremely strong anti-drug message in this movie and stomach watching it , you will not want to watch it again . once is enough . however , one of the primary reasons i give 5 stars is its possible service to those considering / experimenting with / involved in drug use . if you catch your teenager using or experimenting with drugs , preview this movie and strongly consider making them watch it . it is offensive , but it can serve a purpose . for that , and the fact that it is generally well made , i find i must give it a great rating , despite the fact that i wanted to vomit .
positive	top gun is the greatest movie ever made .
positive	i would see it again in a heartbeat . the love and tension between the king and anna could be felt throughout the film -- the scenery and setting were equally captivating . it may take a bit to warm up to jody foster in this roll -- but even if you don't it remains pleasing to the eye .
positive	i just saw this movie last night with a huge group of friends , and i think if all of them hadn't been there , i would have had a nervous breakdown . this movie is terrifying from start to finish , from it's message of don't peek to it's instruction to stay in the light . i normally don't get very freaked out at movies , but this one made me want to close my eyes and catch my breath . it's an excellent movie that makes you afraid to sleep with your light off . the ending is a little weak compared to the rest of the film , but overall it's a wonderfully scary movie that plays on your emotions and your psychological well-being !
negative	having read the objectionable content described on screenit ! , i can certaintly tell you that i would never watch this movie .
positive	i love jack ! !
negative	one of the dumbest comedies ive ever seen .
positive	what can i say about this movie every thing that you want it in a movie is there i'll tell a thing hapend with me in the movies when i was watching this movie when the massenger man didn't help his freind i swere every one in the cienma that show yeld and shouted to help his friend because all of us were completly living the movie .
positive	atmospheric , savage , witty and unsettling . a truly great movie .
negative	i do not like any movie or show that focus' on gays god did not create adam steve he created adam eve . ( a male female )
positive	one of adam's best . those kids playing frankenstein were great . do you want to put on a hooters shirt for old times sake ? whats he talking about mommy ?
positive	the late great sax player dexter gordon was sensational as an expatriate american saxman dying in paris . paul newman robbed him for the oscar in 1986 .
positive	better than the sixth sense in overall story . bruce willis and sam jackson are spectacular . and the ending is nothing you will expect !
positive	superb ! a life affirming movie with a message of hope and redemption . morgan freeman and tim robins as well as a fabulous supporting cast make this a movie that will endure .
positive	excellent soundtrack realy good movie if hollywood ever does a remake first the soundtrack would suck it would be all yo yo and the movie probaly would be pg 13 so don't ruin a classic leave this one alone its fine just the way it is
positive	this is the best movie that i've seen since john singleton's boyz n the hood . if you're into hip-hop / ghetto dramas , this is a must-see . i also recommend dangerous minds , colors , and boyz n the hood .
positive	i love this movie ! one of the greatest 80s movies made . i practically know every line . . . i was only 10 yrs old when this movie was released , and i remember thinking it would be cool to be like ferris when i got into high school .
positive	i think this is a very clever movie , well scripted with some solid performances . if you're looking for many belly-laughs , you'd best rent something else , but this is funny nonetheless .
positive	probably the best and most engrossing film about ww2 ever made . you actually start to sympathise with the crew of what is after all a german u-boat .
negative	the book was alright , but the motion picture was extraordinarily corny and only somewhat reminiscent of the novel . once again , i have to agree with lord of the waves , this was an embarrassment .
positive	i knew the novel before i saw the movie , so when i saw norman bates i was a little fearful that i wouldn't be able to accept him as a psychotic . the book described as being plump and red-faced , but mr . perkins did a great job of being charming but quirky . the musical score is great and this is absolutely one of hitchcock's best .
positive	this movie is one of my favorites . ferris plans everything perfectly with just enough careless fun to pull off the perfect day . great movie .
positive	this is one of the funniest movies ever made but it has to be seen uncut . the plot is two guys join the army thinking its their best bet for the future . they are not you typical soldiers and piss of the di right off their military service takes some very funny twists to the point that they end up in a very well armored rv . harold ramis and bill murray are great .
positive	raiders had a real life hero , real time and place settings , and threw in a little bit of otherwordly magic and actually made it all seem possible . plus , there were unforgettable one liners .
negative	. . . and i still know its terrible .
positive	this was one of the best movies i have ever seen ! ! it had all the elements of a good movie : plot , nostalgia , political issues , suspense . it is a movie that i will definitely want to view again after i have children .
positive	this movie freaked me out . linda blair did an amazing job , no wonder she had to go into therapy after that . the effects are very good considering that movie is from the 70's . i was disgusted at times , but i think this movies is one of the best movies of that decade . if you don't like horror movies , you might want to skip this one cause this one will freak your freak
positive	unquestionably the greatest action / adventure film of all time . spielberg and lucas together make an unbeatable combination . with great performances , solid directing and story-telling and a wonderful score , raiders of the lost ark is the epitome of what good ole' fashioned entertainment is all about .
positive	and the oscars go to jeepers creepers for makeup and special effects ! ! !
positive	very creepy . the end was frustrating , because like so many others , i said " of course ! i should have seen that coming ! duh ! "
positive	this film is amazing and should be the top movie of all time . you can never get bored of it and it brings a smile to your face every time . it's one of those magical things that captures you and won't let go . it's most memorable movie of all time .
positive	come on , how can anyone that calls him / herself a christian give any less than 5 stars ? i feel everyone has a right to thier own opinion but i also feel if you don't feel anything from watching this masterpiece , you are not in touch w / your maker . mel did an excellent job w / this movie . the casting was excellent . i can't say that anyone could have played jesus better than jim . what an outstanding experience . as for people who saw nothing in this film and those of you who are atheist and agnostic's , i will pray for you . : o )
positive	this movie can really show the truth about what is really going to happen . it is a very moving movie and a great witnessing tool . i took as many people as possible to this movie . to people who think that the rapture won't happen , you will be sorry when you are left with termoil and grief . i hope that with writing this that you will check out this possibilty of that happening . anyone that is reading this , please believe .
positive	this was about burning oil refineries in kuwait / iraq , where there were hundreds of these oil fires . i saw it in a cold theater when i watched this , and it got hotter during the movie . the fires were right there in front of me . you could see the oxygen burst , the tendrils of the flames . you could see the heat burn off . i never knew that oil fires were different from ones here in this area . they had completely different machines , and now i knew what they were . the film also showed all the damage that had been done to the countryside . you felt hatred towards the people who caused these fires unecessarily .
positive	amazing ! that's all i have to say . . . amazing !
positive	very creepy and disturbing .
positive	i loved this movie . it wasn't so much scary . it was suspenseful and funny . i loved annie . lockadoodie paper . that's my favorite line . annie was a lunatic .
positive	jim carrey is one of the funniest men alive . i was laughing constantly thoughout the whole movie . you know he is a good actor because of the different characters he played .
positive	american pie is such a funny film ! ! the funniest parts have gotta be the beer bit and the internet dancing ! not to mention the quotes and this one time , at band camp . . . and say my name bitch ! ! did i mention that blink-182 are in it too ? awesome ! !
positive	kung fu and werewolves ? what's not to like ?
negative	highly over rated . while it does deliver it's fair share of campy fun , this is otherwise a boring movie . good mention should be made for slaughtering the pretty little blonde girl half way through , with the an out of control city bus . . . very creative !
positive	not just tom hanks' best movie of all time . . . the best movie of all time . it has every single thing you could possibly hope for in a movie . tom hanks is one of the best actors of all time .
positive	this is the best movie ever made . robin wright is beautiful , the puns are excellent , i couldn't say enough about it . it is my favorite movie of all time .
negative	dismal , preachy garbage .
positive	i thought the jokes were funny . the story line wasn't the best , but still .
positive	a great movie that involves one man's struggle to cope with his own inability to pursue success due to personal insecurities of not only trust , but his own incapability to move forward in life .
positive	truly a modern classic and the the best of the trilogy . it brings out the best in george lucas and steven speilberg . harrison ford was born to play indiana jones . if you have not seen this movie get out of your tomb and get it .
negative	wow . people actually liked this movie ? amazing !
positive	favorite moments : 1 ) danny to sandy ( responding to her what have you been up to inquiry ) : you know how it is , rockin and rollin and whatnot . 2 ) the way marty eyes vic fontain at the dance , 3 ) john travolta pointing to the sky as he belts out a falsetto those summer ni-i-i-ights atop the school bleachers , 4 ) sandy in those crazy tight pants on the shake shack . what a movie ! ! !
positive	i love this movie so much ! ! it's a powerful , imaginative story with lots of fun and disney magic ! ! . it's highly recommended for anybody ! ! !
positive	this is a must see when the auidence gets involved and the participation is high . some people act out the movie while the viewers yell at the screen . the music is catchy . trust me , you will get some lyrics stuck in your head .
positive	another nicholas cage winner . gone in 60 seconds is awesome . angelina jolie is great and her blond locks look good . see this if you like pretty people and fast cars .
positive	what an awesome screwball comedy . i watched this film for the first time in film class last semester in school . this movie gave me the revelation that not all old , black and white films are worthless . the witty dialogue , which is fired off like rapid gun fire , is incredibly acted !
negative	they had a good concept , to use actors who didn't have scripts ( anyone see this as a prelude to all the reality tv crap that's overrunning the airwaves now ? ) with handheld cameras . the jerkiness of the picture was irritating , though admittedly necessary for the type of thing they were going for . but that's about all the credit i can give it . i was waiting to be scared , almost fell asleep through it ( it's extremely slow-going ) , and got left sitting down as the theater lights came up and wondered . . . well ? when's something going to happen ? it might be worth seeing to check out the concepts in the making of the film . . . otherwise , it might be better to pick something else up to watch .
positive	it's a really good movie . i recomend seeing it !
negative	i am a huge adam sandler fan , which is why i went to see this movie . however , i was terribly disappointed at the gross stupidity of this movie . it was not even one those movies that is so stupid it's funny . the humor was disgusting and definately a poor representation of adam sandler's talent as an actor and producer . i would have given this film a rating of 0 if it were an option .
positive	outstanding performances from crowe and phoenix ( who should have won best supporting actor ) assist this already wonderful story and magnificiantly filmed masterpiece . a good old fashioned tale of justice being served , with a twist of course . if you somehow have managed to not see this movie , i strongly suggest that following this obvious repeated smacks to the forehead you deserve , you should purchase this movie .
positive	i have to give this movie a five because i think cameron crowe has such a talent for portraying reality with such entertainment . i really appreciate crowe's dedication to character development ( something often sorely lacking in today's movies ) , his meticulous attention to casting actors that fit the part , and overall his natural talent for depth . with most movies , there's the hero , who's usually flawless for the most part , the supporting characters and the villains . usually i'll only like / appreciate one or two of them , but in jerry maguire i just fell in love with everybody .
negative	prolly the dumbest movie ive seen this year !
positive	although this film requires a good attention span , it is well worth it . the implications of the symbolism are thought provoking . this one film deals with the essence of humanity ; where did we came from , where are we going , what is our place in the universe . it is exciting ; sometimes frightening and disturbing . the special effects were stupendous for it's time , they changed the standard for the sci-fi industry .
positive	george does it again ! ! ! ! you cannot have a zombie movie without george romero . ok , maybe some . but not the originals . george romero's unholy trilogy ( that's night , dawn , and day , of course ) are by far the best . even the latest installment does not dissatisfy . the shopping mall was ingenius thinking . who wouldn't go running to the mall when your next door neighbor , or your live-in , tries to eat your brains ? classic ! !
positive	i find myself watching this film every single time that it is on tv and enjoying it each time . maybe that makes me swayze crazy , but if the shoe fits . . . everyone agrees that swayze and grey are both really good , but jerry ohrbach is also great as baby's father who is struggling with some of the decisions made by his younger daughter . strong soundtrack , as well , even the song sung by swayze himself .
positive	i can't get enough of this movie ! it hasn't worn itself out or gotten dull ! the humor is sharp and the characters are just so ridiculous ! i love this movie !
negative	i found this film to be a disappointment . this is measured not only in my view of the film , but also that of my two daughters who found it quite lackluster . there was entirely too much adult ( sex ) humour for a film directed at kids . i personally don't care for the lowest common denominator humour : gee , the bear has gas and his poop stinks . har har har . it was bad enough directing away question about what is oral sex thanks to bill clinton , now i have a kid asking what an action shot is . i guess after klumps i should have known what to expect ; heck , from eddie's early comedy act i should have known what to expect . the movie is slow , the humour is weak , and the there is nothing that makes you really care what happens . sorry , baaaaad movie .
positive	it s one hell of a movie . these things aren t made today . and that s a shame .
positive	this movie is funny ! ! ! ! ! it was alot better than the first one . alot of action . i highly recommend it !
positive	good movie . . . nick cannon was great for the part becuase it didnt take much talent to pull in off . gq ( nick white friend jayson ) was probably the funniest . had great songs and greta beats but unlike the music in it , the story just didnt flow
negative	hated this film as it was very dark and created a macabre feeling in the senses . of course , that was its intention , but a disconcerting one nevertheless .
negative	not even stylish direction could save this tired mess of a movie epic . quite boring and not enough substance to keep itself interesting or engaging .
positive	the theatre on screen
positive	absolutely 'boy's own' fiction . . . superb stuff . an adventure that has you rooted to the spot .
positive	all about three men getting involved with a baby that was left on their steps . they get very attached despite being wild bachelors .
positive	will smith is a date doctor , teaching all the pathetic guys in new york how to pick up even the most stunning women . his motto is that any man , at any particular moment , has the ability to sweep any woman off her feet . he knows all the right moves , all the right things to say , until he meets the girl of his dreams . will smith and kevin james are hilarious .
negative	this has got to be the worst movie ever . i was so looking forward to seeing it and i could not believe that i wasted my money on it .
positive	my favorite fairy tale !
positive	this movie was great ! ! ! i enjoyed it very much , and i wouldn't mind seeing it another time . maybe a 3rd and 4th time also . thats how much i loved it . * 'meoshe' *
negative	i'm not a star trek fan at all and i'm not quite sure why i actually saw this movie . i thought it was horrible . i kept waiting for herve villecheve to come out and give mr . rork a hand .
positive	awesome movie in every aspect . wonderful suspense , i love the camera flashing at the end ! ! ! ahhh
positive	this is a brilliant movie , both in direction and artistic value . it shows how art can be the ultimate gift of oneself and how art knows no boundaries - culturally , religiously or socially .
positive	alfred hitchcock made many a great film , but if you are looking for the deepest example of his own artistic expression and personal fetishes , vertigo is the film to see . the film is very mysterious and other-worldly . you almost feel as if you are in a dream . the vibrant colors are at once soothing but can be uneasy and , at times downright cruel . the ghosts and spirits of alfred hitchcock's dreams are displayed with startling perfection , in this one of the most important works of the cinema .
positive	i loved this movie ! it was by far the funniest i've seen in all my life .
positive	almost famous is the best movie i have seen in the last six months . this movie is strong in every element . the casting was amazing . the film gives a great view of the 70s rock and roll scene through the eyes of a young writer . i found the script very unmanipulated , and i never felt as though i was hit over the head with any point or emotion . i found myself in tears at one point in the movie and i was not sure why . i believe it was the sincerity of the story and the telling of it that moved me to tears . the most memorable moments were not words at all , but instead visual images that contained much power and emotion . i would recomend this film to anyone who can appriate a good story , a good cast , and a heartfelt experience .
positive	this movie has so much potential and it carries with it so many different emotions , such as : joy and sadness . robin williams has perfected the character very well and the way his heaven is his wives paintings is an idea i have never heard before . you really have to watch it several times to understand it !
negative	terrible movie , i hated it and can't believe they made a second one . jim carrey is loud , obnoxious and not funny , more on the side of exaggerated and gross . i don't like movies that insult my intelligence .
positive	this drama-cum-ghost story set in war-ravaged 16th century japan , from the shakespeare of film , kenji mizoguchi ( whose other masterpieces include sansho the bailiff , story of the late chrysanthemums and the life of oharu ) is one of the most beautiful films ever made , voted among the 10 greatest in sight and sound's international poll . blessed with the serene fluid camerawork , exquisite cinematography , painterly compositions and ravishing landscapes for which the director ( still terribly neglected in the english-speaking world ) was renowned . the scenes where the potter falls under the spell of the enchanting lady wukasa are a peak of world cinema .
positive	this movie shows us there exists only a fine line , at times , between sane and insane . in addition , what is considered insane is a matter of opinion and decided by a few people ( psychologists ) , which can be dangerous . for the time , the movie brought people into the institutions for the mentally ill , and showed the terrible conditions and primitive techniques for rehabilitation . the main character also has his own delusions when he believes he knows best what's for the mental patients and trys to force them iont society , and finds they breakdown . he realizes some people really do need to be institutionalized .
positive	wow ! for a twisted movie this one is really , really good . it covered many socio-topics and portrayed the cast almost magically . by the end of the film i was exhausted , having seen the lives of the people grow or die . the bathroom scene and swimming in the toilet dream will forever be burned in my mind .
positive	not many actors could pull off being on screen for a major potion of a movie alone , and make it interesting and belieavable , but tom hanks pulls it off wonderfully . one of the great acting challenges of our time , and tom hanks lives up to expectations . he gives an oscar-worthy performance , and propably would have won had he not already captured two other awards earlier in his career his co-star , wilson , really stole the show and became the star everybody loves . helen hunt did her best in what essentially was a throw-away role , a role that was poorly written . her photo in the locket was the real preformance here . still , castaway remains one of ijr's favorite flicks and ijr says check it out ! !
positive	great movie . mike is awesome in it .
positive	okay , so it's corny and cliche'd but it's also a lot of fun . i really like it 'cause it's got that feel good factor about it . the soundtrack is good too , and it's ending is pure cheese fantastic ! ! !
negative	this is a real disappointment , i was expecting a lot more from christophor guest and eugene levy . it is not a funny movie it is actually kind of sad how these people pour their entire lives into their dogs . if you have to see it wait until it shows up on cable .
positive	what a captivating , compelling military drama which is nearly perfect in every department . a solid story and phenominal acting alone makes this film worth watching . jack nicholson gave his best performance ever in this film , delivering those famous lines : you can't handle the truth ! . his acting prior to and after saying that was just so intense and phenominal it makes me wonder why he didn't win the oscar . tom cruise was also at the top of his game , and he was equally intense in the famous courtroom scene with jack nicholson . this truly is a drama that will thrill you and keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish . unmissable !
negative	i wish there was a rating lower than terrible . . . . .
positive	im sorry , but imo this movie was absolutly scary as hell . i was honestly scared for days . lol
positive	a very good movie . and the music is even better . i knew it was just a matter of time until they were doing a musical . elton john did a fantastic job . this movie is timeless .
negative	i hated west side story . it was so boring and so mindless . the acting was terrible , and there was like not one single thing that i liked about this movie !
positive	another side splitting comedy . ben stiller kept me rolling with his acting . the farelly brothers humor is gross and very funny .
positive	funniest office movie ever .
positive	scared the crap right out of me when i saw it the summer of 97 . totally ingenious ! a movie filled with cheers and jeers of other horror movies . i was impressed .
positive	i loved it ! i loved the idea ! imagine living your whole life ( using the bathroom , masturbating , digging your noise , taking a crap ) , not knowing that the rest of the world is watching you too . the idea that there is someone controlling your environment and you are just a guinea pig in some aliens experiment or something , is scary . it's kind of like the matrix . way cool .
positive	the first time i saw this movie , i thought it sucked . but , like a fungus , it sorta grows on you . adam sandler is not my favorite actor , but in this film , he is just terrific . kathy bates , playing mama , gives her usual great performance , and is the highlight of the movie . henry winkler , fondly remembered as the fonz , plays a losing football coach whose luck is turned around by sandlers waterboy . the plot is basically predictable , but that is okay with this movie . there should be a sequell .
negative	the single worst movie made about the arthurian legends . nice shiny armour though .
positive	the greatest war film made ever ! ! ! shot choppedand scored perfectly gritty and realistic , brings you into the boots of the soldiers . one of my top five favorate movies of all time .
positive	i thought that this movie was the best that i have ever seen and sean patrick thomas was wonderful along with julia stiles . everyone in the world should see this flick .
positive	this film is fantastic . ridley scott at his best . its protagonist , ellen ripley , defies the stereotypes put on strong women characters . she's no elle woods ! did anyone besides me notice the windchime theme , throughout the movie ? they were everywhere ! anyhow , it's a timeless classic .
positive	in my opinion , alvin lee and ten years after , stole the show with going home . but the whole movie was great .
positive	an excellent awesome great adventure flick ! ! !
positive	this film was the perfect close to the most explosive trilogy in film history . of the three origional films , this one is definately my favorite for a number of reasons . the battle scenes were wonderful , and the special effects , were , as to be expected coming from george lucas , absolutely breathtaking . everything seemed to come into place in this film with the death of yoda and the subsequent death of darth vader . i enjoyed the last 30 minutes of the film the most , espescially the final battle scene between vader and luke , and i thought that having vader save his son by killing the emperor was the perfect way to solidify that old saying- blood is thicker than water . at least that is how i interprited it . in my opinion , this one was the best of the entire trilogy and the perfect closure . btw , the ewoks are awesome !
positive	i really enjoyed this movie ! a great amount of action , fun for the whole family ! 4 . 5 or so might be a better rating , but overall it was very entertaining . i'm not a big fan of nicolas cage , but it's easy to forget about him watching this movie . engrossing , and riley was hilarious .
negative	what an embarrassing movie ! watching a little rat in cowboy boots , running a major coorperation in a small town inhabited by guniea pigs ? terrible excuse .
negative	amazing how this movie holds up . the atmosphere alone makes it a must see . alfred was in top form on this one . a true classic .
positive	this was absolutely the best movie of the year . extremely well-written and acted . you'd think , reading about this movie , that it would be sappy and / or depressing - it wasn't . it never dwelled on the bad stuff , and had many laugh-out-loud scenes . truly a pleasure .
positive	gigantic artistic effort . wonderful satire of the hollywood 'activists' & has a sing-along soundtrack as good as 'south park : bigger , longer , uncut . ' can't wait for the dvd . one caveat : if u love the cannibalistic deranged torturers who run north korea , maybe it is not for u .
positive	this movie had an interesting yet more complicated story line . the graphics were very good considering what year it was made .
positive	this movie is one of my favs because it has matt damon and ben affleck , two very good guys and actors . the movie has a good plot . i also love robin williams .
negative	ironically , this is what i said when i heard that jennifer lopez was in another movie .
positive	this is my favorite military / nuclear war satire as well as my favorite peter sellers film . people who are fans of this kind of movie know that in 1964 dr . strangelove , another nuclear war satire , had peter sellers playing multiple roles . but five years earlier in 1959 sellers also played multiple ( and similar ) roles in the mouse that roared . the film was made during the height of the cold war when nuclear bombs , air raid drills and possible invasions were a part of american life . the smallest country in the world , the duchy of grand fenwick , has one means of income and that is a wine called pinot grand fenwick sold chiefly to the united states . when a california wine maker puts out an imitation and calls it pinot grand enwick the duchy is on the edge of financial ruin . protests to the u . s . government are ignored . however , the duchy has also taken notice that whenever a country loses a war with the united states , the american government sends financial aid to rebuild the country which they have defeated . duchess gloriana ( peter sellers ) explains all in all , as i said before , there is no more profitable and sound step for a nation without money or credit to take than to declare war on the unites states and suffer a total defeat . the duchy of grand fenwick then declares war on the united states . chief forest ranger tully bascombe ( again peter sellers ) gathers an army of about twenty longbowmen , charters a tugboat , and they invade new york city intending to surrender as quickly as possible . as luck would have it the entire city is deserted and everyone is underground for an air raid test because nuclear scientist dr kokintz has his new secret weapon , the q-bomb , within city limits . the army wanders around the city looking for someone to surrender to when they are spotted by a civil defense team that mistakes them for aliens from outer space due to their 14th century uniforms . they end up at the new york institute for advanced physics where professor kokintz has built a working model of the q-bomb . the grand fenwick army captures the professor , his daughter , the q-bomb , a u . s . army general and four new york policemen . when they arrive back at grand fenwick and inform the government that they won the war instead of losing it , the heads of government panic and resign and tully bascombe is made prime minister . they form a league of little nations and every small neutral country offers to protect fenwick against any attacks . to resolve the matter the united states surrenders and they hold talks . the imitation wine will be taken off the market and grand fenwick demands a million dollars but the u . s . negotiator insists they may have to take a billion . grand fenwick also demands that they keep the q-bomb and that the u . s . and russia have a general disarmament supervised by the small neutral nations of the world . if that doesn't happen they threaten to explode the bomb . the president of the u . s . asks his secretary of war do you believe they'd really explode the bomb ? the secretary answers would you have believed they would invade the unites states with twenty longbowmen , landing in manhattan off a chartered sailing vessel ? the movie is a clever satire about war and also has many little comparisons about life with and without the bomb . there is also a great understanding of human nature depicted in many characters , particularly at the end when duchess gloriana refuses to marry the american minister because , she states , americans are cruel to their wives . they treat them as equals . they refuse to make any decision without consulting them . they load them up with worries they should keep to themselves and when there isn't enough money they send them out to work instead of earning more by their own efforts . if i am to marry , i want a husband who will be a man and let me be a woman . i'll be able to handle him better that way . the mouse that roared is every bit as much of a satire as dr strangelove but it is far more lighthearted and good family entertainment . peter sellers is excellent and the movie is not only still funny but it's also still relevant even in the 21st century . one of my all time favorites , indeed .
negative	i hate steven seagal movies . he is a lousy actor with no personality
positive	wonderful , wonderful movie . it tells the story of 3 war vets who meet by chance on their return home . they all live in the same city , and you get to see how their lives continue and all the heartaches they have to overcome . this is a movie everyone should see at least once . it surely shows that once a man has been to war , things will never be the same again for him .
positive	i wasn't sure what to expect out of this movie . i bought it at first , because mark ruffalo is in it . it isn't a film for everyone , but i loved it . it takes you through a wide range of emotions . and although it ends tragically , it leaves you with a lot to think about .
positive	i enjoyed the movie , i expected it to suck because of ben affleck being in it , but i liked it , i liked it a lot . he did a good job , so did garner . good movie .
positive	bravo , kathy bates
positive	just as exciting and entertaining as the first film . spider-man 2 definitely lived up to the first film , and in many ways surpassed it ( especially in mixing drama and comedy ) . the spider-man films do not seem to be going downhill in quality like so many previous superhero sagas have . let's hope that the upcoming addition to the series keeps it that way .
positive	this is a really good movie ! i'd have to say that the best part of it was the way that it was visually presented , with a dark , bleak atmosphere pervading the entire film ( with a few important plot line exceptions , of course , such as the oracle's house ) . there was a great amount of visual detail throughout , especially in the climax , which was arranged to look just like a shoot'em up , arcade style video game .
negative	insanity ! ! how does this movie even compare to a real film ? any positive feeling this movie could have left me with was sucked away by julia stiles's nonexistant acting talent ! blech . give me a break mtv , i can't believe i payed to see this movie , someone out there , somewhere , owes me 8 bucks !
positive	dot is sooooo cute
positive	awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww !
positive	i love the scene where they bait the klan guys with the where the white women at ? line . i also like the badges . badges ? we don't need no stinking badges ! update : before irish calls it i'll admit badges was a rip off .
negative	best career move for vin diesal ; not being in a pointless sequel . thge cars took center stage as usual because the plot was horrible . when you have a movie with ludicris and tyrese , what would you expect ?
positive	one of my favorite movies of all time . michael j . fox is a terrific actor . part 2 is not on this list which i even like just a little more . . . but nevertheless this movie is incredibly unique and satisfying .
positive	* * update 8 / 10 / 04 : i just saw this movie again 2 nights ago . by the beard of zeus , it changed my life . again . * oc : if there was a vendor selling anchorman the dvd for $ 75 a pop in the theater lobby i would have picked up two on my way out . in case i lost one . this is top-five comedy quality on an all-time list . i'm not kidding , it's right up there with the likes of naked gun , airplane , and caddyshack . ron bergundy - jazz flutist , great hair , scotch-lover . a force to be reckoned with .
negative	with respect to ford and connery , this movie is a worthless abortion . the effects are cheesy , the timing is off , the plot's not so scary , and the degeneration of serious to fluffy that must befall any remarkable franchise or trend as it gains popularity and settles into routines seems especially pronounced in this threquel . it has some funny , silly moments which are welldone , but if i had it to do over i'd just burn the seven dollars and watch t . v . for two hours .
negative	i fell asleep .
negative	i fell asleep .
positive	wonderful use of montage at the end . the director did a great job of making you side with these bad guys , a little controversial for violence , but i didn't think it was that bad , compared with today's violence in movies .
positive	this is one of my favorite movies of all time . not only did it start jamie lee curtis' career , but it led to other halloween movies . this is one of the only movies that has scared me . the cinematography on this movie was outstanding .
positive	i loved it i think it had cool songs and the voices when great and werent oddly off and i dont think it ment that u should disobay ur father its jus u have to go for what u think is right even if it means ur father would get mad cuz even they can be un reasonable i liked the crab he was cool
positive	brilliant plot , lots of action- you really get caught up in it all . this film is at the top of my favorites list .
positive	sick flick with hella special effects . keanu reeves deserved best actor while the hot chick from threesome also did a stellar job .
positive	despite some huge book-related errors ( elves at helm's deep , faramir , etc ) this is a great movie . i haven't decided whether it's better than the first , but it truly is a masterpiece . it contains both the best introduction to any film i've seen , and the best film battle i've seen . it may not be 100 % accurate as far as book translation goes , but some is warranted and as a movie goes , it is brilliantly entertaining and has a little bit of everything . a must see , and bring on the third .
negative	this movie was incredibly boring . it took too long to figure out what was going on and by the time you did , you didn't even care anymore .
negative	this garbage makes you root for the snake . another j lo piece of art .
positive	they should've quit while ahead and not made the sequel . there was no reason for the color of money to have won any awards when compared with the original .
positive	i found this movie enjoyable , pity what happened to brandon lee .
positive	a true classic ! ! ! great songs , great characters , great story . nice good guy / bad guys . a true classic and revolutionary in its time .
positive	i have seen this movie 4 times in theatres all ready- and mr . good dosent know what hes talking about- this is one of the funniest films i have seen in a long time . great film
positive	this is the best movie paul sisson has ever seen . klitz is the man !
negative	rarely have i seen a film that was more boring or held my interest less than this poor excuse for a romantic comedy . it certainly did not even begin to utilize the abilities or approach the usual standards of the cast involved . the most glaringly apparent problem was the misuse of the considerable comedic talents of billy crystal . he barely had anything to do or say and what he did say was far below par on the humor / wit / taste scale . in particular , the scene with the dog had the distinction of sinking even below the standards of a junior high school boy s locker room . julia roberts , cast as catherine zeta-jone s mistreated sister / personal assistant , did manage not to scream and giggle every ten minutes , had a few good lines but her overall character was poorly written and pretty unbelievable . after seeing even a small bit of the insulting treatment she continuously receives from her completely self-centered movie star sister you can t imagine what would have kept her from smacking her silly long before this point in their lives . so , it made no sense that this woman would suddenly grow teeth and fight back after an apparent lifetime of accepting abuse simply because she was now involved with her sister s ex ( john cusack ) . overall , i m not sure what portion of this movie made it not work most poor writing , directing , or just an unfocused murky concept . but one thing i do know , considering the many past successes , efforts , and combined talents of the cast i give them little , if any , of the blame for the failure of this film . they simply had very little with which to work .
positive	one of the greates movies i have ever watched . great direction and very well documented . shows the strength , wit and fear in a war . documents family love and love for your country .
positive	this movie appealed to my own gnostic beliefs , so naturally , i give this one the nod over passion ( which was good in it's own right . )
negative	manages to make the first two , ( which are so bad they make my teeth hurt ) look like great art .
negative	incredibly horrible version of the classic h . g . wells story , with ludicrously bad performances from everyone . whatever happened to jeremy irons ? he used to be a pretty good actor once upon a time . i'll tell you one thing , i would never want to have to go up against that guy on the old game show " make me laugh . " decent actor , but his career isn't merely going down the toilet , it's clogged in the pipes .
positive	this is a classic and one of the best animated disney films . cruella devil want the dalmatian puppies to make a fur coat , but the owners won't let her .
positive	norma norma norma
positive	great entertainment ! this movie has just reset the standard for sci-fi . i can't wait for the sequel .
positive	this is a classic that you can watch 700 times . it has a suberb soundtrack . it has sexy actors . it is a wonderful story that is unique in itself .
positive	favorite movie . it never gets old . everytime i watch i laugh so hard .
positive	silence of the lambs is high on my list of greatest movies ever made . next to the exorcist and shining , definently one of the best horror / thriller films . anthony hopkins became my favorite actor after i saw this movie because his performance was the most breathtaking of it's kinda i had ever seen . and i've yet to come across anything to rival it ( i didn't see hannibal . i read the book and thought it was disgusting . i didn't want anything to tarnish my memories of anthony's performance or the movie . ) it was just so masterfully crafted , every syllable of every word he spoke , every little time he blinked or moved his eyes , every little , rare gesture he ever made- although what made this hannibal guy so damn scary was that he didn't move . he stood perfectly still and always gave the observer this tense sort of-when-is-he-going-to-jump-up-and-eat-somebody feeling . you kept expected him to do something like that . . . but he never did . not when you expected it , anyway . that , i think , is what made the scene with the guards near the end so amazingly frightening . he became almost this animal after a whole movie of never moving , never doing anything untoward . he became likable , even , this genius sociopathic murderer . his great line about the census taker still gives me chills to this day . i could write forever about the brilliant nuances of hannibal lecter , but i'm commenting on the movie as a whole , so i guess that will have to wait for another time . jodie foster , too , gave an excellent performance , what with that west virginia accent and her heartfelt descriptions of the screaming lambs . something that makes this movie so brilliant though , was that besides the chaotic exchanges between clarice and hannibal , there was actually a really frightening almost side story about the serial killer , buffalo bill . clarice's scenes in his house were so chilling , they stay with me ( as does a great amount of things from this movie ) to this day . johnathan demme did an amazing job interpreting ted tally's outstanding screenplay and gave a such a dark , creepy air to the whole movie . silence of the lambs is one of those few movies that you can watch 20 times and still get scared . if you haven't seen it , firstly-are you crazy ? ! do you live under a rock ? and secondly , go see it ! ! ! ! ! you will enjoy it , i promimse you .
negative	welcome ! to horror movie hell . hehe . i don't have three days to spend listing the flaws of this movie so i will just brush over the top . first it is by the guy who did the equally terrible urban legend . his visual styling is cute and all but it can't save these poo poo scripts . the characters are all inept and unlikeable . you honestly want them all to die horrible deaths . the deaths start out good but then as if it were a kiddie film just turn into sell out deaths and leave you with dull boring and unimaginitive deaths . like when a certain big breasted bimbo gets trepped in the hot tub by a sheet ao hard reenfirced plastic and the killer is drilling down at her the killer gives up after 15 seconds and tosses the drill into the tub , electocuting her . whoopdy doo ! haven't seen that before . not even haveing the beautiful work of the deftones on the soundtrack can help this peice o trash flick out . the ending and last death is really quit funny . go see it if you are really bored and like disapointment . would you hide in a body bag ? and if the killer began stabbing the contense of every bag in that room would you stay perfectly still or run for it ? like i said , these are some stoopid ass kids .
positive	the best movie ever made in the history of movies along with the original and star wars . unforgettable lines , twists , and characters fullfill this movie to its best .
positive	the redux version fills in some holes and makes more sense . watch that version if you can .
positive	ok pre-wwii film noir flick staring jack nicholson as a hard-boiled private eye getting in way over his head .
positive	best movie ever ?
negative	ha , ha , ha , ha ! ! i didn't even have to see this movie to know it was one of the worst films ever created ! mariah and talent do not bekong in the same sentence unless the word bad is also used . the story is obvious and has been run into the growned over a hundred times . now it is miss mariah's turn . strange how she had a mental breakdown just days before her movie opened . doesn't seem like an obvious desperate attempt to stur up contoversy and maybe temt some dim witted suckers into seeing a lame and dare i say cliched to the foulist depths of hell peice of poo cinema . if you have half a brain , do not waist your cash . this has been a message from the anti - pop stars turn actor / actress comitee . i support real actors and actress's in film .
positive	i must've seen this movie over 100 tiumes . it was my favorite movie as a child , and remains my favorite to this day . audrey is amazing in this movie . who would've thought that someone as classy and flawless as audrey would make such a great eliza doolittle ? as much as i love julie andrews , i think audrey was perfect for the screen version of this classic .
negative	an over-hyped piece of trash . . . no plot , corny dialouge , and bad acting . lara croft wouldn't be such a poplular video game character if she didn't have gigantic boobs . even my dad says that there's only two good reasons to see the movie . . . i'll let you guess what the two reasons are .
positive	this movie is well worth the price of admission . hilary swank gives a stellar and convincing portrayal of brandon tina . i highly recommend this movie to everyone . keep in mind it is a bit disturbing .
positive	it was an interesting combo of war and love .
positive	you can never go wrong with an adam sandler movie . guaranteed laughs .
positive	you either love it or you hate it . it depends on your sense of humour . if you have my dry british sense of humour , then it is the best . i think they should get back together . ps ( beware of the killer bunny )
positive	classic hitchcock ! he simply has no equal ! superb directing , and casting all around .
positive	this movie is great , it gave sylvester stallone his first break to be a shooting star . it also gets into the controversial idea of sacrificing your life for your country , but all the system does is shaft you in return .
positive	this is a hilarious movie ! vince vaughn and ben stiller are a riot in their roles , as well as the hysterical supporting cast . and when they have those classic hit-in-the-face shots , they're actually funny . this is definitely a great summer movie . age range : 13 + . it's not necessarily inappropriate ( though at times , somewhat , but not often ) , but some of the humor would be hard for younger preteens to understand . final grade : a
positive	exploding . . . . heads . . . . are . . . . funny
positive	i wanted to murder dern's character in this movie he was such a bastard ! i could really feel the intensity in this movie . great !
positive	the acting in this movie was beyond exceptional , some of the best i have ever seen . leonardo dicaprio was born to play romeo , he made the myth real .
positive	i watched x-men before watching patriot . i think patriot edges out x-men . i think patriot was highly accurate , and i was surprised that it turned out better than i had hoped ! i will see it again . i almost cried when i saw benjamen martin carrying the flag !
positive	shaft is outstanding , doing justice to the character in the book and the original series . the hand-over from richard roundtree to samuel l . was handled very well , without getting sappy and without relying on the old man to fix everything . the casting was excellent , and the actors played their parts well . the writing was a little predictable ( especially the you killed my brother bit ) . a lot of great one-liners are laid down with precision timing . the gunplay was handled professionally , with only a couple of very obvious mistakes ( semi-auto handguns don't go click click when the slide is locked back , and the kahr ( excellent choice , btw ) only holds 7 rounds in the mag and one in the chamber . . . in the scene running from the house shaft pops off 9 + rounds without reloading . but , on par , they did a good job showing him going empty and reloading the firearm . the final error i would note is that , after being shot in the chest at close range , vanessa r . would not be running around like nothing happened . . . vests impede bullets , but you still get a heck of a punch in the sternum ) an all-around cool movie , and samuel l . is a bad mother . note : this is a samuel l . film ; expect blood , violence , guns , and more blood .
positive	anyone , and i mean anyone , who has ever been accused of road-rage should love this movie . sure , the cars are nightmarishly cheesy and stallone proved to anyone who has seen this movie that he can't act , but the movie is awesome . in a futuristic society , death race is the main spectator sport , supported by the government and loved by everyone , even the victims ! a mind-blowing concept ! pop it in and watch this movie . a real classic ! ( hey sis , how much for the dirtbag on the corner ? )
positive	i thought it was a great 70's movie . good actors and who can forget shelley winters !
positive	the best love story ever ! this movie ecompasses all aspects of love between a woman and a man . the historical setting of the revolutionary times in america make it all the more beautiful . the love of a native who falls in love with the daughter of an english general . their love withstood war , death and time .
positive	classic . hopkins - great ! i like it when it looks like jodie foster is going to shoot me .
positive	this movie was great in the sense that it explored a war hero as he had never been explored before . surely the commander was a good man and a great solider , but his lust for greatness and legend came over his want to fight for the cause . this was eventually his demise . i do agree with pbeavr , this isn't exactly a war movie , it's really more of a character exploration and story telling movie , and a great one at that .
positive	i don't think it's possible to hate this movie . there were some funny moments with a lack of plot holes .
positive	this movie rocksssss
negative	poorly written , directed , and acted . jim carrey turned in the usual horrible manic performance , the female lead was equally bad . and the plot was idiotic . easily the worst movie of the year to date .
positive	i went to go see this with a very good friend of mine and we both loved it . unfortunately we missed the very beginning of it - but with what we saw , we loved the simplicity of the plot since it was just the four main characters . the film is very simplistic and there are no huge surprises . its quite realistic in terms of emotion - not in terms of what happens in real life . it certainly struck a chord in me . its a very good little , simple striking film .
positive	a very good movie . it shows the mind of a killer and how he became like that and acts the way he does points to childhood . the movie could help society see what murderers and serial killers go through in life to become like that . it showed thaa everyone has innocence and how family affects the way you act and think .
positive	kevin spacey's best movie . he gives a better performance than in seven .
positive	this is a 3 hour plus joyride that is both fun and funny . each actor involved brings their own brand of timeless humor to their charactor , culminating in an american comedy classic .
positive	this movie totally pulled the viewer into it . it keeps you puzzled as to whether or not the main character did the crime he was accused of . the ending is terrific .
negative	this sucked donkey balls
positive	if you are familiar with the x-men comic book series , this is a great movie with special effects and an exciting movie script .
positive	absolutely brilliant film ! ryan phillipe plays sebastian , a wealthy attractive promiscuous young man , who make a bet with his step-sister ( sarah-michelle gellar ) . the bet is to sleep with a published virgin ( reese witherspoon ) . wonderful twist at the end a must see .
negative	honestly , the movie was more boring than scary .
positive	as a young person conditioned by today's flashy eye-candy movie-making , i really have to up my patience in order to appreciate most of the classics . even when i do that , a lot of them still strike me as having a little too much hype built around them . but this movie truly impressed me . besides the fact that it managed to keep my attention , it wasn't too feel-good or ambiguous , nor was it presented too matter-of-factly . it also showed the scale of nazi brutality without too much gore .
positive	big is a delightful comedy ! tom hanks is actually believable as a boy transformed into an adult . the scene where tom hanks applies for a job is absolutely hilarious . i also love it when he arrives at the office party wearing an outrageous tuxedo and when he takes elizabeth perkins back to his apartment for a sleepover in his bunk beds .
positive	i always liked this movie . no one gives the blob creature enough credit , though . it must have had supernatural powers . you see , it was so slow-moving that a snail or an earthworm could have made a quick get-a-way . but , the human victims froze in their tracks . . . too paralyzed with fear to even inch backwards and , thus , met their fate . . . alien aspic . . .
positive	wounderful i still laugh when i think of it .
positive	best action comedy of all time . eddie needs more of these .
positive	my family & i loved this movie we are excited about seeing meet the faukers we can hardly wait hope to see it real soon
positive	i guess the aunt edna croaking scene makes the movie .
negative	i'm sorry , but it's about a sled . named rosebud . maybe i missed something , but i didn't like it at all . i think it's overrated .
positive	this is a great movie with thrills and laughs
positive	james whale proves why he is the greatest director of horror films with the invisible man . claude rains was the perfect choice for the invisible one considering that fact that he acted almost completely with his voice . and what a voice it is !
positive	se7en is one of those rare films that not only astounds the viewer while it is playing before their eyes , but burns an imprint in their mind long after the final credits have rolled . and for a serial killer film to be memorable at all is a great feat in itself . not only has this movie got an impeccable cast , script , direction , etc . , but the only thing unoriginal about it is that it involves a serial killer . everything else about it is innovative and thought provoking . a city drowned by a monsoon may not be an original film idea , but a city in sunny california being pelted by an endless downpour is ! the cinematography was in color , but the only colors vivid in the film were greys , dingy browns , and black ! the serial killer involving the cops in his scheme of things to be the final victim is something that is astonishing ! with spacey's monologue the viewer may find himself / herself making sense of murders that were so senseless and inhuman and with that the serial killer brings the average , normal person to his level of reason . what is so ironic about this film is that john doe seems to be the one trying to find god in a place where god just doesn't exist- the relentless rain and muted colors are a sign of that and , in the final scene , the roles of victim and killer are reversed . every time i see this film , ( 15x and counting ) i can't help but to be left in bewilderment and in awe !
positive	zany british humor cannot be done better than by the monty python troop . my father made me watch this when i was young , and ever since then , i have been hooked on monty python . their hilarity is of a most unique brand , and this movie stands out as probably being their most widely accepted film by american audiences . there is absolutely no character development , and for good reason . their wit is outstandingly brilliant , and this film is filled with some of the best brainless comedy around . the audio and film work are below average , probably due in part to the film's budget and its foreign development . this film is highly recommended , and now for something completely different .
positive	hey kids ! wondering what it was like to live in the us during early 1980's ? well , nothing provides a better dose of reagan-esque , kill-a-commie-for-mommy , right-wing , gun nut paranoid propaganda than watching this movie on a lazy afternoon .
positive	hilarious especially when ever he got pissed off at the ball when it wouldn't go in . or when he beat the crap out of the guy becuase the ball wouldn't go in the hole he was tryin' but it just wouldn't go in . or when him and bob barker got into a fight and uttered those words that i think everyone wanted to say . -the price is wrong b * * * h-
positive	i'm just a big reese fan . her natural cuteness sells this film .
positive	the rocky series are my favourite films ever for so many reasons , the acting , the fighting and everything else is all brill ! the rocky series also brought hope to the little guy in which they never get a chance ( or in rockys case never got a shot at a decent title ) my favourite line of the whole film has to be in rockyiv where apollo ( just b4 his fight ) says i feel like i could eat nails , stallion ! rocky replies i'v seen them snails in the garden but i'v never wanted to eat them every time i see that clip i always laugh . after watching every film roughly 30times i still dont know my favourite . thats how good these films are . i heard a rumour that a rockyvi is on the cards in which rocky steps back into the ring 1 more time but we all no when rocky says just one more fight he really means just another 20 . hope the rumour is true . rocky ! rocky ! rocky ! rocky !
positive	besides the fact that pulp fiction had all the elements of a great movie done by an brilliant writer / director , it served also a gateway to a lot of people . it proved to so many that a film doesn't require a lot of money to be truly a piece of cinematic art and indie films were finally getting the attention they deserved . it inspired a host of tarantino imitators to create colorful , violent crime films from the sublime ( the usual suspects ) to the mere forgettable ( truth or consequences , nm ) . but what is so amazing about this film ( and hasn't even been touched on in this slew of reviews ) is that with tarantino , nothing is sacred and everything is fair game ! accidental murder results in name calling and a hilarious aftermath , sodomy / rape results in a comical bit where butch can't make up his mind which weapon to save his enemy with , racial slurs are used repeatedly by a white guy who , consequently , is married to an african american woman , and jules ( who breaks a major commandment for a living ) recites word for word a quote from the holy bible . this film has shined a light on the most taboo of subjects and made us not only stare in wonder , but made us take notice of the one film that mirriors society's own irreverence !
positive	one of the greastest comedy movies of our day .
negative	what can i say , this is at the top of my worst sequels list , right next to urban legends , final cut , i still know what you did last summer , and halloween 3 . ok , its jason takes manhattan , yet the entire movie takes place on a cruise ship exept at the end when they drift ashore on manhatton . the last 20 min . of the movie is in manhattan . it was cute when the black guy got his head blocked off , but honestly , if a couple of punks were giving jason sh * t , would jason really just show them his face ? this movie was a travesty to the friday the 13th series . besides , jason looks so decayed in this movie that a stiff breeze would take him out . this movie sucks !
positive	one of the most brilliant movies i have ever seen ! ! !
positive	the best comedy of the year ! ! ! brilliant ! very hilarious . casting is great ! rush out and see it !
positive	as always with adam sandler's movies , this is a very funny movie . it's original and a really enjoyable movie .
positive	return of the jedi , is , in my opinion , the best of the star wars original trilogy . all of the action , suspense , the atmosphere is just right . george lucas can make movies , and well . there are many reasons to see the movie such as , the emperor has a larger part , the war ends , the rebels defeat the empire . there are too many reasons to list . han gets freed , jabba dies , and the death star blows up . the digitally remastered version makes the movie even better than it already is . this is a must see movie .
positive	mt vote for the funniest moveie of all time .
positive	a qualitative step ahead . computer graphics and suspense make it look real . the leading role is played by keanu reeves , which really doesn't make a lot of sense from the point of view of an aesthetic person . other roles played fine , including the negative characters .
positive	this movie is really good . it shows that girls can have a good time while running a bar . me and my friends related to the characters in the movie .
negative	i can see why goldmember was panned by the critics . it's a really , really bad movie . my expectations weren't high to begin with , but it didn't even come close to making my trip to the theater worth it . my biggest complaint was that it contained very little new material . even worse , the old material was stale and even pathetic in places . the plot revolving around goldmember was uninteresting , and goldmember was a disgusting old guy who ate patches of dead skin that peeled off his body . ( i'm not kidding ! ) mike meyers' acting seemed forced and choppy , and there was no chemistry between him and foxxy cleopatra , his female helper . goldmember lacked the fun , silly feel of the second austin powers movie , and the pace was slow . i don't recommend seeing this movie in the theater or on video .
positive	woody allen is hilarious , and not only does every scene of this movie make you think wow , i thought i was the only one who got that ! but some of the scenes are pretty darn amusing , both due to great writing and his ingenious acting .
positive	city slickers is a great movie that most don't know about ! !
positive	i love carrie . however , i am disturbed by what she had to go through . carrie white is a tormented and made fun of high school girl . people throw tampons at her . the walls are spray painted with the nasty words carrie white eats sh * t ! and no one seems to even care that this girl is being unfairly treated . not even this girl's mother . unbeknownst to them , carrie has telekinesis . basically , in simpler words , she's going to kill them . and they're going to die a very gory death . what i like about this film is that it does not justify or promote what carrie or her tormenters do . every bad thing the characters do come back to haunt them . and unfortunatley , most of them suffer at the hands of carrie . but in a way , we can't really blame her . the girl gets viciously abused at home , thrown coffee on , shoved , pelted with tampons , and told to eat sh * t every day . so it's no wonder why she strikes back at these ruthless tormentors . it may not be right , but we can sympathize with her for the hell she endured .
negative	doesnt make the grade . this move is unsuitable for little children yet too childish for adults . the troupe is knocked out by poppies . an educated person can tell that poppies are the producers of opium . so it implies that these heroes are really druggies . these loveable charecters whom children want to be like influence them to do things the majority of them might not have done if this movie was not shown to them .
positive	i love the seamless way that coppola mixes a gangster film and a jazz film into one , without any of the tired , corny clichs that you find in a lot of the latter day musical ( until the final sequence , when it totally catches you off balance ) . its also very effective in using historical figures and events as a backdrop to a fictional story . incredible cast , nicholas cage is at his best in an early role , bob hoskins and fred gwynn are brilliant and richard gere is actually acting , instead of being richard gere . and a very young diane lane is his love interest . the period recreation is pitch-perfect , with duke ellington , cab calloway , charlie chapin and louis armstrong showing up . the piece where they inter-splice gregory hines's solo tap dance with the hit on dutch schultz is one of the finest moments that coppola has ever filmed .
positive	this is probably the most moving aspiring and most touching , riveting , movie i have ever seen ! it's the life of a poor young black woman ( whoopi goldberg ) who's sold off into a marridge where her own kids and husband hate her , but soon this woman makes her own living and makes her own revenge and prosperity . i reccomend this movie to everyone .
positive	i like kevin bacon , and i like footloose . this movie made me dance and dance often .
negative	words cannot describe how awful i thought this movie was . it wasn't the acting , which i thought was good . it was the use of modern music in that era , it just didn't work for me . when like a virgin came on , that was it for me . i watched the rest of the movie with everyone else , but that was the point of no return . they could have had a wonderful movie without the stupid use of music that doesn't fit with that era . maybe i'm just too much of a history buff , i just couldn't stand it .
positive	the master movie from the master himself - sir alfred . being a lifelong movie buff , i can honestly say that no movie has caught me so off guard by its sheer jolt power . just when you think the movie is taking you in one direction - it does a complete 180 - and does it several times . psycho is the holy grail of all suspense / horror / thriller films . the portayal of norman bates by anthony perkins is incredible - once you see it , it's totally inconceivable that anyone else could possibly played the role . not only my favorite horror movie , but my favorite movie of all time . if hitchcock was van gogh . . . psycho would be his starry night .
negative	worse movie ever
positive	ever since it's release , raiders has been the gold standard to which action movies have aspired to .
positive	as of now this is my favorite movie . julia was so great in this movie she put on a good performance as she is a killer dancer . . . . . .
positive	this movie is great . it is vulgar and offensive but it's just a movie ! i would probly have to say that this is the funniest movie i have ever seen .
negative	i agree with irishgit : junk !
negative	one of the worst movies i have ever seen .
positive	great movie ! funny movie ! great cast !
positive	what a great cast ! it's great to enjoy a well-written and well-acted comedy . lisa kudrow shows that she performs as well in full-length movies as well as on friends . and deniro and billy crystal play off of each other beautifully . enjoy !
negative	watching this movie is like eating bad breath . terrible terrible terrible movie . even mean girls is better , and that hurts to say . . . but boobies beat ass-crack any day . don't see this movie
positive	this movie is another of the great movies of all times . it creates a modern mythology while never losing sense of 'story' .
positive	in the beginning of comedy , there was mel brooks .
positive	three words . . . kathey bates naked ! ! !
positive	wow ! you know , i wasn't sure to see this movie at first , since the reviews were very mixed . but finally i decided to rent it and give it a shot and i was just blown away ! i thought the story was really good - simple enough to be on film but complex enough to be interesting . and man , i've never fallen so in love with a movie before ! love stories don't usually grab me but i was just crying like there's no tomorrow at the end of this one . i know plenty of people don't like nicole kidman but i find her skills dazzling every time i see her , and ewan macgregor's performance was breathtaking . i'm glad i got to see him in a role that finally allows him to bear his amazing talent . i'll warn you , this movie is very subjective ; plenty of people didn't like it . but if you've been searching for a fiercely romantic feast for the senses that isn't your run-of-the-mill romantic drama or hum-drum romantic-comedy , then i recommend you give moulin rouge a try .
negative	worst movie ever !
positive	these go to eleven !
positive	just as good as the show ( ok , maybe better ) , i can't wait for more ! !
negative	renee zellwegger : overrated .
positive	the sound alone was oscar material-make sure you watch it with a good sound system
positive	my dog skip . . . . very umotionall made me pour out teers . its about a boy with not many friends in the 1940s during world war two . his next door niehgbor is a famous baseball player and he gives him tips on baseball and they are good friends . then the famous baseball player goes to war . the boys ( i dont remember any of the names ) mom gives him a dog for his birthday without his dad knowing . he almost has to get rid of the dog because of his dad . but he gets to keep him . this dog makes his life alot better . until everything goes wrong . . . . . i give it a five
positive	classical music will never be the same again . this is one of the greatest psychological thrillers i've ever seen .
positive	i watched this movie as an annual event until i was into my 30's . it's timeless . i bought the dvd so my 4 year old granddaughter can enjoy it . possibly the greatest movie of all time .
positive	johnny depp steals the show . again . he also wrote his own character's ominous , sexy theme music !
positive	i guess this movie was too much for dart to understand .
positive	i thought this movie was soooo funny ! i cant like explain myself why i liked it but its a must-see so just watch and see for yourself .
positive	gossip . . . . gossip . . . we want gossip . . . .
negative	this has to be one of the alltime worst movies . it is just hard to watch . as a story it fails , as a musical it fails terribly . just a bad movie .
positive	this john ford movie should be much further up the list ! john wayne is a misfit and a loner on a quest to rescue his neice who was stolen by the indians . why does wayne's character really want to find her ? duke is more of an anti-hero than hero here . the last scene is terrific--wind it back and watch it again .
positive	event horizon rules . one of the best sci-fi / horror / hounting movie set in outer space you ever get . you have to get some guts to see the blood though , but it is not a movie about blood . it is pure monster-less horror . really hounted ! my sci-fi number # 2 after matrix ! sadly there are people who don't think this way , but it is really underrated movie .
positive	desrved every thing it won . can only be compared to who's afraid of virginia woolf . see them both now !
positive	great drama , great effects . story was well told . . . . . .
positive	one of the weirdest and best movies you may ever see . the matrix combines awesome special effects , a great story line , and spectacular acting all into one of the best sci-fi films ever . this is a must see for any fans of the unusual . don't leave the movie store without it .
positive	graphics look realistic . realistic images of life . the storyline is good and interesting .
positive	stupid but bs is so hot id like to suck her titties
negative	this has this distinction of being the only movie to cause me to fall asleep in the theater . skip it and rent an older bond flick .
positive	the poiseidon adventure unlike many other action films , has an extremly winning soundtrack featuring the song , the morning after . anyways , the movie is extremly heartpounding and astonishing . the special effects are amazing , and it is so much better then titanic .
negative	i hte werewolves and i hate salt and vineger pringles . once i pop i just cant stop puking . this movie was stupid . alls im saying is if you really wanted to blow people to crap it wouldnt be as difficult as they make it seem . uuuh rahhhh anarchist cookbook
positive	this movie is amazing . the storyline is so well written and the acting is also pretty good . i just love the idea of this movie . i could watch this movie over and over again . it is by far the best of the trilogy . i can't believe this movie is already 20 years old . i remember when it came out . this is when you start feeling old .
positive	denzel , is too much . he is the best .
positive	jack nicholson was hilarious as a fiction writer with multiple mental poblems . he and helen hunt had a special chemistry that i haven't seen in a long time- despite their age difference . when i saw it in the theater , everybody raved about it . i could feel how much the character played by him loved her son .
positive	excellent film ! it was very touching . a chance for many african-american male actors to shine . it was a historically based film that was semi-accurate . no unnecessary battles / bloody scenes . at the time of release , it showed a part of history few knew about . great musical score , haunting melodies .
positive	im not even bored of after seen it 13 times . one of the best action movies ever made .
positive	i love silly movies
positive	this film was very funny ! although it was descusting in parts wich made it that little bit funnier because everyone is like 'ewwwwww' ! i rented this on dvd and im now tempted to buy it !
positive	a wonderfull movie . george lucas' look at growing up in california in the '60's . a must for any collection .
positive	it's the most classic movie . i love that it made me cry when most movies are so fake these days . it gave me and understanding of young boys .
positive	the award-winning fim-which was recently re-released stars richard dreyfus as duddy who schemes his way to acquiring restricted land in a great adaptation of the mordecai richler classic .
positive	a classic stanley kubrick movie , who is incapable of producing a bad film . the movie was both hilarious and poignant , reminiscent of catch-22 in its satirical yet altogether believable portrayal of world militaries .
positive	greatest martial arts film in history .
