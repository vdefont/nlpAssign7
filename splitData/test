positive	only a few words describe this wonderful , wonderful movie . women rule ! when i left this movie , i felt like i could do anything despite what people throw in my path .
positive	this movie is one of the best action movies of all time . it has so much feeling and action at the same time .
positive	not many movies really make you laugh out loud throughout , but this one sure did . hysterical !
positive	what a terrific disney movie . if i were to rate my favorite recent disney animated full length movie it would be this one . very well done , good songs , funny and romantic . i saw this at the theater with my kids and enjoyed every bit of it . the characters were fun to watch . the talking clocks , and other objects . i loved it when belle and the beast found they cared for one another . this movie has some of the best songs . be our guest and the rest . no wonder they turned this into a broadway play .
positive	been a while since i seen this movie , but i do remember it being hilarious .
positive	i thought this movie was funny . he actually had 3 teams of fact checkers and 2 teams of lawyors go through the whole movie to assert everything was fact . i do however agree with he uses his biased opinion to present his information . but that's what biased film makers do . i don't agree with everything he says , but we need someone like this to oppose the common belief and to open minds in our society . and hey , it won an oscar , it can't have been that bad . i thought the film was very entertaining . no it's not about guns ultimately , it's about the us being a culture of fear , and guess what guys . i'm from australia and i've lived in the us for 3 years now . it is a culture of fear . he was right .
positive	theme is about how everyone has their own sense of what finding beauty in life entails . the film illustrates that the traditional model of american beauty -- a nice home with your family in the suburbs -- can be a shallow facade and not as fulfilling as it appears . the theme suggests that deviating from glorified suburban ideals ( by taking a fast food job , dating someone younger , befriending a misfit , being mistaken as gay , etc . ) will bring you fierce recrimination , yet may be the only way for some to discover true happiness in life . the movie wasn't designed to be an uplifting crowd pleaser , as much as one that provokes with its message . while i was uncomfortable watching the movie at times , it was intriguing and affecting enough for me to want to view many key scenes a second time immediately afterward . as the movie states , where some might just see an empty bag floating in the wind , another might see beauty .
negative	horrible casting . none of them could have ever been losers because the look too pretty . plot stunk like rotting flesh . best scene is the dream sequence in the credits .
positive	best movie i ever saw . everone should see it .
positive	a great comedy and does a great job as a spoof . cary elwes is a great comic actor , and dave chapelle is the funniest guy alive . is callmetootie here ? cause i hate her .
positive	world war i is one of the great under-studied wars of all time , chock full of its own unique , hellish drama . can be paired with either all quiet on the western front ( 1930 ) - the other greatest wwi film drama , or kubrick's lesser ( but still good ) other war drama , full metal jacket ( '87 ) , set in vietnam .
positive	it's a great movie . it shows you the innocence of that time . you see richie grow up and the hardships of his family . you gain a great understanding of his life , his family , his music . it's a touching movie about a great musician . if anyone loves donna this is a must see movie .
positive	i'm 11 years old . i thought this movie was great ! ! ! i've seen it 3 times and i rate it my favorite movie ! i've been waiting for it to come on video and pleased to say its coming out on november 21 . i think everyone should see chicken run ! ! ! !
positive	the scarest film of all time and i've saw them all
negative	what i have to say will not earn a helpful rating from anyone , but i'll say it anyway : this movie was corny in places , stupid in other places , and it had violence . i couldn't find anything to like about it .
positive	water boy was hilarious - adam sandler's best
positive	a really funny , family movie . the kids are great actors and the story is great .
positive	it was hilarious and the graphics were fab !
positive	a movie that you can watch over and over again and never get bored . you just can't help but be drawn in by ferris's unique charm . he's the guy that we all want to be . i thought that matthew broderick played the role perfectly , and what a hilarious performance by jeffrey jones . i never get bored watching this movie , and if i ever see it on when i'm just browsing the channels , i'll watch it despite the countless times i've seen it before . the movie's blatant sarcasm is what i like best about it .
positive	i found this movie phenomenal on all levels . the cast had excellent chemistry and amazing talent . the script was a beautiful mix of poetry , humor , drama and plain insanity . i think many were able to associate with the characters on one level or another , especially reaching out to teens , who can often find commonalities with the main character and perhaps the others as well .
positive	awesome movie ; acting was great !
positive	pretty ok .
negative	x-men seemes like a promising movie . my favorite wolverine failed to meet the standard . special effects were pretty cool but overall the story didn't go anywhere . action is low and the plot is an absolute disaster .
negative	only saw a few minutes of this horrid movie . i am glad american idol got wise . after this junk . a very sad kick back to the beach party movies from the 60s . kelly at least managed to go on and have a career . as for justin , where is he now ?
positive	better than the first one . not too many movies get better than the original , but this one does . it continues from the first movie , but it seems to have more violence , which makes it off the hook .
positive	we loved seeing this movie today . my 9 year old twins , my 11 year old daughter , my 14 year old son and myself . this was a lot of fun , i am such a fan of antonio banderas . the only thing that bugged me ( not my kids ) was that they forgot to wrap up at the ending the rescue of the people the whole movie was about rescuing ! oops but otherwise it was a lot of fun . i've never seen a movie with so many gadgets .
negative	they did not follow the plot of the book , they did not have all the charracters from the book , where the hell was mekare , the real queen of the damned ? jesse and lestat did not , nor will they ever end up together . where was louie ? he was supposed to be kissed by lestat before lestat ever went out on stage . armand was not blonde , is not blonde , and never in his everlasting life will he ever be blonde ! he is russian , with long red-brown hair . pandora never died , she still lives out her existance hating and loving what she is . where as lestat's mother , gabriel ? she should have at least had a minor part in the movie ! this movie is one of the worst i have ever seen . every copy should be burned .
positive	this is a great movie . i love it . the sets for this movie look so empressive along with the cgi . and the idea of cloning dinosaurs isn't to far fetched . this movie is truly one of the greatest spielberg movies of all time . it is exciting throughout the whole movie and you are captovatide the whole way threw . if you havn't seen this movie , it is a definate must see . it is truley a great movie .
negative	what was the imax thinking ?
positive	this movie was actually pretty funny , seeing as it had many aspects to it : romance , gore , comedy , drama . it was a good movie , if you don't mind a few profanitie and sex scenes here and there .
positive	shows the graphic reality of war . one of the best story lines ever . awesome performance by tom hanks .
positive	this was such an original story and script . it was able to play off well with the story of good versus evil . there was a lot of good action and the costumes were cool .
positive	my favorite movie ever , you will fall in love with it . i have yet to share this movie with a friend where it has not quickly become one of her favorites . a great story , i am not the emotional type , i didnt cry with all my friends at titanic , etc . , but this one did it for me !
positive	great film . slightly confusing until seeing the end of the film and watching it again .
positive	just about the funniest movie i had seen in a long time . one of the rare movies that i can watch over & over .
negative	apparently , i'm one of the few who thinks differently than the rest about this movie . i hated it . i'm beginning to come to the realization that i hate fantasy , sci-fi type movies that last for hours . i did not appreciate star wars , harry potter , or this . i read the harry patter books , and liked them fine . i'm considering reading these , althought the movie is a huge deterrent . i vow , from this day foward , never to sit through another movie like this .
positive	does any body think thet the director made it seem that the main character matt damon died in the mexican prison and the rest of the movie was what death was like for him . because all through the movie there were mentions of death and weird things happened after he was stabbed .
positive	one of the most influential horror films scince the texas chainsaw massacre . john carpenter really out did himself this time . micheal myers is one of the most interesting , unique , and creepy characters ever created . this movie keeps up this creepy feel to it and well , this is one of the foundations of horror today . great score too , really goes with the movie . this is a must see horror classic .
negative	it was the brits who did it all , the americans were not involved . dont cry people , no americans died here , so of course no one died worth crying about . i wonder , if the film had been made with english accents and the subs were called 'hms whatever' instead of 'ss whatever' would this film have ever been even seen in the us . somehow i dont think so . this makes me sick . claiming the heroic deeds of the british as your own and not mentioning them at all .
positive	ben hur was a revolutionary movie with respect to special effects featured in it . most notably , the sea battle , and the warrior cart scenes are outstanding . of course , considered from our turn of the century point of view , those effects may seem 'primative' ( bad word ) but the movie as a whole counts as one of the most significant in movie history . also by depicting biblical events and the historical surroundings in a very attractive way .
positive	this movie is very interesting because it is supposedly based on a real life situation , even though i'm not sure about the spooks haunting the house , but it was a good movie , keeping me on the edge of my couch . i gave this film a 5 .
positive	the comedy version of indiana jones . one of those movies you don't get tired of
positive	go see this movie . the special effects in this movie are best ever created . while the first one had plain , ordinary deaths , the deaths in this one are superb ! its more silly than the first one . i dont want to give away the deaths on here but if you really want to know how they die just leave me a personal message .
positive	i was 4 when star wars came out and my parents took me to see it when it came out , i have grown up all my life loving the star wars trilogy i am a fan but revenge of the sith is the best star wars movie yet , if even only for the unbelievable effects , which is why everyone in 1977 went to see this unbelivable movie it is the perfect final movie for the perfect beginning . p . s . i love all the star wars movies and i am praying to my yoda god to pls pls pls give us the last three . if you enjoy any star wars movies then you will love this .
positive	it's a film to watch and experience a surprising change of heart a man on death row can have . watch it and learn how to forgive anyone !
positive	groundhog day is without question of the funniest and most inventive comedy i have ever seen . . . . . brilliant brilliant brillaint ! ! ! ! !
positive	chris tucker is an awesome actor he is so funny . jackie chan is cool . he is an awesome stuntman . the first movie was good this one is great .
negative	its just bad . the story is terrible , the acting is very weak . the comedy in the movie wasn't even funny . to the ppl who created this : plz end yourself
positive	munich is a triumph . ( jaws : fish bites boat . . . . . . . . . . et : a fuggly alien can be cuddly . . . . . . . saving private ryan : wwii was about dumb-dumb matt damon ? ) this movie is speilberg's redemption song . eric bana is a knight on a quest to vanquish evil , but as we know , like the poor , our lord said evil will always be with us . . . our best friend our intimate enemy . the violence and the shock value puts other hacks to shame . . . . . . . . ( scott / scorcese / attenborough / coppolla / peckinpah / tarantino etc ) these lessons of munich will be learned & re-learned , off screen & off -----god help us .
positive	just as good if not better than toy story .
positive	great script , great cast , great production . this is the movie i never hesistate to recommend to people . oscars for best original screenplay and for kevin spacey for best supporting actor , were well-deserved . see it !
positive	patricia arquette's presence helped me to overlook the occasional hole in the story . great commentary on / against organized religion .
positive	our local radio talk show host ( chuck baldwin live pensacola , florida ) bought out 2 theatres showing the patriot and offered free admission to his listening audience as a thank you for 6 years on the air . over 350 people of all ages watched and all loved it ! i would rank it as good as a gone with the wind epic and i really appreciated a movie that i was able to take my kids to . it taught them some history and patriotic principles . there were some very violent scenes , but i think it needed to be told to show children the horrors of war and the price for freedom !
positive	fantastic . i'm a huge fan and i love every song in the movie .
positive	this is a real masterpiece . not only one of the best movies about judgments in the history but one of the best i ve ever seen . incredible group of characters performed by actors like james stewart , ben gazzara or the beautiful lee remick . preminger doesn t need to show you the characters more than a minute for you to know them well . that s classic cinema . fine camera movements , great use of the time ( not the videoclips we are used to see these days ) and a marvellous script that doesn t use the flashbacks in order not to give you subjective information , you only know what happened thanks to what characters say . you can believe it or not . that s intelligent . because at the end , you can only still supposse what happened ! . if you haven t seen it , go and look for it ! , i promise you won t regret .
positive	one of the few good cartoon films that isnt made by disney . does anyone remember the land before time puppets they gave away at pizza hut when the original came out . the sequels are crap , especially when they try to bring singing into it . this though is quality .
negative	it's horrible the animated version is awesome but , this is terrible imtatiaon the animated version rules ! ! this one sucks ! !
positive	very heartfelt - a tearjerker too . you really , really feel for marty and his girl , even when he screws up from being so rusty . it never casts a dim light on women even though it's told from the man's perspective . well , let me amend that - his mother and aunt are nuts , but other than that , this movie is a great character study that everyone will sympathize with .
positive	i think this is jim's best movie , he pulls of the premise flawlessly . a lawyer that can not lie it is unheard of even ridiculous but jim does it for 24 hours and it is very funny .
positive	forrest gump is a beautifully directed film that deals with important contemporary issues . it presents issues of single motherhood , aids , mental retardation and advocacy . forrest gump is a great story of how one man with a very low iq became very financially successful . it is a story of rough beginnings and great adventures . forrest gump represents the best of what a decent life can be .
positive	this is a great movie and it is really funny a must c 4 all skateboarders and all people who really dig funny movies i hope they make a grind 2
positive	classic . one of the best movies ever made . yes the dance movies are great , yes the storyline is genius , yes gene kelly and debbie reynolds are wonderful , but it's jean hagen who makes this movie great .
positive	awesome ! sandra bullock and benjamin bratt also did a very good job . i really god the feeling of thier relationship as others didn't . well , i highly recomment this movie to comedy lovers !
positive	one of my favorite comedies . debbie reynolds and albert brookes really did a great job with this funny script . the lines are really humorous and reminded me of my own family . i highly recommend renting this .
negative	if stephen king was dead , he'd have rolled over in his grave
negative	if i could give this movie a minus rating , i would . this movie sucked so bad , i got my money back at the ticket booth ! don't waste your time on this one , or your money . absolutely horrible ! they just don't make horror movies with any real horror in them nowadays . the last movie that actually made me pick my feet up off the floor in sheer terror was the exorcist . do yourself a favor , rent a classic , and hold your honey tight .
positive	you just know they're making fun of star trek fans , but even being a trekker myself , i loved this movie . the laughs don't stop ! !
positive	great movie -- i'm usually lukewarm about the coen brothers , but this movie really touched me . my favorite part was that the cop's husband turned out to be designing stamps . seemed at once humbe and noble .
positive	great movie -- i'm usually lukewarm about the coen brothers , but this movie really touched me . my favorite part was that the cop's husband turned out to be designing stamps . seemed at once humbe and noble .
positive	joybyc , do you know how to comment on movies ? then i will tell you : you're suppose to give a reason why you didn't enjoy the movie , not if you liked it or thought it sucked . it's only idiots like these people who put austin powers movies down , everybody else ( including me ) thinks they're brilliant !
positive	this movie is funnier every time i see it . brilliant performances-especially by john goodman .
positive	i thought this film was very beautifully filmed , very simplistic and very , very good . as some of you may know , i'm not a religious person , but i did appreciate this film . to anyone who thinks that subtitles are distracting - you are missing out on a wealth of fantastic foreign films , unless you can withstand disgustingly bad dubbing with horrible voiceovers . i think one of the reasons why i like this film is because it wasn't screaming at people to believe in jesus and god . it was just simply saying 'this is what this man suffered and he took it on' . it could have been rounded out a bit better , but the essence of the story is there . the scenes of him being whipped and nailed to the cross were convincing and certainly made me wince . hats off to mel gibson , he could have gone over-the-top and made it longer than 2 hours and far more intense , but he kept it in line and i definately do not regret having this in my dvd collection .
positive	the lost boys has to be one of the best vampire films ever made . the cast is great . keifer sutherland and jason patric are great . the soundtrack to it is great . death by stereo ! ! !
negative	i thought this movie was dumb . i should have went high . seriously , i laughed once .
positive	claudette colbert . this movie , the pace of the humor , the way they fell in love- the hotel , i love this movie and can watch it over and over again .
positive	i loved all the songs in this movie . the captain's children were all sorts of ages , and it was easy to read and understand their thoughts when compared to your own thoughts and experiences at that age . the scenery was beautiful and the story was great .
positive	kurosawa's adaptation of king lear is a beautiful , if a trifle long , work of art . i wouldn't put it at the peak of his craft , but it is excellent work .
positive	this movie rocks ! ! ! ! 1
positive	cast away still has me thinking about what life would be like living on a deserted island for 4 years with practically nothing . tom hanks did a spectacular job in this role . the movie was very realistic both in the beginning , middle , and end . i know many people didn't like the end , i thought it made the movie even better cause lets face it , not everything has a good ending and it made it realistic . the special effects were good and i liked how the dialog was minimal as well as the musical score . this movie was wonderful
positive	the godfather is mario puzzo's best creation . it being turned into a movie is even better . the corleonne family was to good to not be televised . a must see if you have not . very powerful . outstanding preformance by marlon brando and al pacino .
positive	dan ackroyd and john belushi are comic geniuses , and this is there masterpiece work . there are some trully hilarious moments and the soundtrack featured some of the best blues you will ever hear . the laughs come a mile a minute , so put on your sunglasses , fill up your tank and sit back enjoy two hours of absolute comedy at its finesy .
positive	this movie is so funny ! ! and this is my good eye .
positive	even though babsy is a political nitwit , she is brilliant as fanny brice in this highly entertaining film .
positive	austin powers , from the beginning to the end , is really funny . for instance when he is dancing on the street and the cop walks up to them , they all stop dancing , then start again with the cop dancing too . and dr . evil is no doubt the most lovable evil villain ever . his wild schemes that always get messed up make his character excellent . 5 stars for sure .
negative	astonishing . seldom has so much time , talent , energy and money in such a triumphantly atrocious piece of dog excrement . has to be seen to be believed .
positive	just saw the newest version of this movie and i loved it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it's scarry as hell ! ! and the zombies move faster than humans , which makes you freak out more . this movie makes you think , what if it really happened ? ? ?
negative	boring , brutal . . . . what happened to this train wreck .
positive	i think the movie equilibrium is the best scifi movie there is after the matrix
positive	i felt i had to rate this film to point out an error a lot of people seem to be making . the fighting that everyone is going mad about in the film , while being very accurate and thus nasty to watch , is also supposed to symbolise the inner turmoil going on within edward nortons charachter . the person who recommended people watch it but fast forward the fight scene's , is mis guiding people . the fight scenes are as important as the rest of the story , as they are supposed to give you an actualisation of his inner turmoil . well , in my opinion , anyway . one more point- everyone seems to think that the main charachters name is jack ( nortons ) , but if you watch the film again , you will see he only adopts this name after reading an article in a magazine he found in the house he shares with tyler- something about jack's kidney or something- anyway the point is we never find out his name , as it's not considered important because all that happens is done by tyler anyway . opinionated- i am , right- your call !
negative	just dreadful . but what else could it be , having that awful book as a basis .
negative	painful to watch . catwoman & hellboy the one two punch of the " b " rated superheor flicks .
positive	the movie was one the best ( if not the best ) . it's definetely on my top 10 list . it brings out such a great message that sometimes we take for granted . freedom . mel gibson was terrific . . .
positive	resident evil was one of the best scary movies in a while due to the fact that it didnt try and scare u by grossing you out with a whole bunch of blood and guts , but by playing with your mental fears . and thats why it gets a five star rating .
positive	the best scary movie ever !
positive	this is said to be the best french movie ever produced , and i don't doubt it a sec ! it's fabulous ! it gives you such a good feeling , although amelie doesn't only do good things . . . but we forget it 'cause the other people ( the ones she doesn't treat very well ) are very bad people themselves . it's said that amelie discribes a perfect society that doesn't exist anywhere and which wount be realized ever . . . i'm not so sure about that . what the film discribes is creativity and actions done by heart . i know this exist . i think the people commenting saying that amelie is unrealistic , say so 'cause they feel themselves would never be able to live up to the ideals of the movie . but don't blame the audience for that . i know many people as good as amelie in the movie . take gandhi as an example ! i would like to recommend to the entire world to go to the nearest cinema and see this beautiful film ! this movie is actually said to better than la vita e bella ( life is beautiful ) , american beauty and psycho , and i can see why ! it has become an integrated part of the french president eleccion campaign . . . it'll paralize me if it turns out that amelie don't win the oscar for best foreign movie this year ! : - )
positive	you're joking , right ? this movie started a genre of high-quality science fiction films no one has seen since 2001 . eyes popped and jaws dropped . seeing it for the first time was an experience i will never forget .
positive	this movie easily amazed me when i first saw it . the dark atmosphere it projected was beautiful , and the presentation of the alien was excellent . you never really saw the whole alien in a single scene , which gave for a mysterious feeling . at the alien was an original concept . the birth and life cycle or the creature seemed very original to me . and this movie had a good story . the reason i like this movie more than the others was because sigourny weaver wasn't the glorified heroine . she was just another equal member of the crew trying to survive .
negative	atually , i'm a big fan of tbwp . . . after watched the first tbwp , i always try to find the conclusion . i think all of you , want it too . is that right ? suddenly , when i heard the news 'bout the next blair witch ( bw 2 ) , my heart start pushing me to buy the movie . . . . but finally , after watching the bw 2 . . . . i felt regret . . . it is because the movie is sick . . . suck . it just wasted my money . before buying the movie . . i think that the movie will start at the rustun parr's house but is not . i would like to suggest that the next bw will continue from the rustin parr's house and make a conclusion ( whatever it's true or not ) . keep up a good work . . . .
positive	the greatest bruce lee movie of all . a lot of excellent fight scenes . the movie has a very good plot . this action movie set the standard for martial arts movies of the future . best martial arts movie of all time .
positive	best legal comedy ever ! two scenes come to mind imediately when you mention this film to me . scene one : in the cafe , vinny picks up the menu . shows the menu to his girlfriend : 'so what do you think , breakfast ? ' 'breakfast sounds good . ' then they show you the menu , with three things on it ; breakfast , lunch , dinner . scene two : in the court room , vinny is crossing a witness . 'isn't it possible that the two yout's . . . ' 'say what ? ' 'excuse me your honor' 'what was that word ? ' 'what ? ' 'did you say youts ? ' 'yeah . ' 'what is a yout ? ' 'oh , pardon me your honor , two youthssssss . '
negative	stupid picture . stupid actrees .
positive	i am not usually a fan of thriller movies . especially those slasher ones . this one was good . anthony hopkins was great a s hannibal lector . a psychiatrist who is in jail for murdering people and eating them . yet he has a brilliant mind about understanding the minds of killers . there is another serial killer on the lose who kidnaps women skins them and kills . them . jodie fosters plays clarice who is hired to investigate the crimes and help find the killer . she goes to hannibal who is in maximum security to talk with hannibal to help find the killer . he agrees help so he can be transferred . there are some good chillingly frightening scenes in this movie between hannibal , clarice and tracking down the next serial killer who we do get to see , { a real freak of a guy } as thrillers go this was a pretty well done movie .
positive	i am not a huge star wars fan , but when i went to go see revenge of the sith i was amazed by all it had to offer . the special effects along with the scenery was excellent . i enjoyed the acting very much . this movie really dishes out all emotions . i love the part where obi wan and anakin are battling it out and at the same time yoda and the evil chancellor are fighting as well . this movie has a ton of action and gets really sad as anakin destroys everything so great with just one poor decision . hes that character you love to hate . go see this movie .
positive	one of hitchcock's masterpieces as well as one of the best films of all time ! excellent picture !
positive	another fantastic film in john wayne's portfolio of magnificent films .
positive	all i have to say is that this film should have won the best picture oscar !
positive	one of almodovar's best and one of the funniest movies ever made . carmen maura is outstanding as the harried and much put-upon protagonist .
positive	john ford's classic western with john wayne is still worth seeing and still deserving of 5 stars after all of this time . this is the benchmark against which other westerns are measured .
positive	this was my mom's favorite-she likes yule brenher and it was about siam . i like the costumes , setting and era . the music is great . being asian , i was immediately captured by the culture , and don't recall any other asian muscials so it is even more special .
negative	comedy , no . accurate representation of karaoke subculture , no way . well-written , ixnay . engaging , only the storyline about the man who quits his job and goes crazy ; but - it went down the tubes and the promise was broken .
positive	this movie , when compared to pocahontas is less offensive and does show what american indians believe in their stories they tell . truly , the animal characters are cute ; and surely a fine movie to watch one who feels sympathy after taking the life away from a momma bear and learning how it is to a bear while taking care of the orphan . though it did not win an oscar ( finding nemo won for best animated film ) , it is great that it got listed as a nominee . ( see disney's masterpiece movies in weblists for a similar comment on this movie . )
negative	who are these apologists ? the critics were right to trash this dog of a movie .
positive	this has to be my all time favorite . it is a wonderful film .
positive	no matter what others might say . . . this film is good . the story is excellent , ( as many harry potter fans will tell you ! ) and the directing has made the magical side of it stand out in a fantasical quality . for all the fans out there i do agree that it is a great movie . the director has done a great job bringing the books to life so far and i think that this film was better than the last one . having read the books there are a few differences in from the orginal story , but how can you expect a movie from such an imaginitive book to be exactly the same as the written version ? this film following from the perviuos is one of those rareties . . . a sequel that is actualy as good ( and better ) than the first one . . . i look forward to the next movie and advise everyone to try and see this film . it was one of the must sees for the past year and now that its on dvd its even better !
positive	this movie was great ! i am a huge fan of the evil dead trilogy , and this is one of my favorites . just like army of darkness , is your looking to be scared , this is not the movie to watch , this movie is hilarious . bruce campbell does it again with his great one liners and great acting . bruce campbell is my hero . bruce campbell is back at the cabin this time with his girlfriend . he dicovers a tape player , plays it and the adventure begins . yet another perfect blend of horror and comedy . sam raimi is a genius . i highly reccomend that you see this movie , a guarunteed laugh riot ! gotcha you little sucker
negative	when i first tried to rent this , the guy at the video store snatched it away from me and said i'm sorry , i just can't let you leave with this movie , it's that bad . now i know why . this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen , but it's not that far behind , either . it's like a really crappy rehash of ringu ( japanese film , 1998 ; the american remake , the ring , came out in 2002 , the same year as feardotcom ) , with the same basic idea of if you watch this , you will die in x amount of days . i did like the reasoning behind it ( a tortured soul wanting revenge ) , but it just didn't make for a strong story . the true antagonist's motives were never really explained ( he just kind of liked torturing women for fun , i guess ) . the excessive nudity and violence , some of which is highly disturbing , seemed as if it were there only for shock value and nothing more . if your local video rental guy really cares , he won't let you leave with this video .
positive	the meaning of the wall is that we r all in this confusion together and that killing yourself is not the way out and all people go through the same emotions and high times and low times
positive	real great movie its about a girl who wants to find her true dreams well then theres some problems its not just easy squezzy she has a boy who likes her and almost get fired
positive	outstanding !
positive	it would great to have a mogwai for a pet , providing you don't get them wet and feed them after midnight .
positive	dr . suess was genius with the christmas special it's funny , classic and a very good cartoon movie ! !
negative	they're running this hideous thing on television now . so , i thought i'd see what all the negative hype was about and i watched part of it . i can't believe it ; these two dinks actually managed to come up with a new film genre - comic porn . both sad and funny .
positive	i'd like to rate my uncles movies but ive only seen cool runnings . john candy was my great uncle . . . i never met him personally . what happened to him ? i dont want to bring up the subject in my family , it might be too upsetting ! !
positive	i read a review of this movie that said you forget you're watching someone play ray charles , and it couldn't be more true . jamie foxx was incredible . and you probably couldn't find a more interesting life to make a movie about .
positive	dustin hoffman brings the house down in this delightful comedy , that paved the way for mrs . doubtfire and other crossdressing favorites . a different movie from most other comedies thereby making it deserving of a high rating for individuality if nothing else . not to mention that it is insanely funny .
positive	best movie ever ! ! ! i've seen it nine times and bought the soundtrack its amazing . so is catherine zeta-jones as velma . she soooo deserved the oscar
positive	could this be another oscar for kevin spacey ? i think so . this was definitely a movie with a message . i thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recomend it . pay it forward is a great concept , and a great movie .
positive	an intense psychological thriller and especially great if you've seen the other movies before it . acting was amazing - anthony hopkins and julianne moore were great .
positive	the best movie in the world .
positive	the best movie in the world .
negative	i have seen better flops from a fish on a river bank . . .
positive	one of the greatest movies ever made . brought forth a feeling that we are not alone . sort of like orson wells radio broadcast of the aliens attacking .
positive	aliens was ahead of it's time . caseless cartridges , suspended animation , etc are all real things now .
positive	jack did good ! ! strong plot and subtlely humorous .
positive	arguably one of stanley kubrick's most exciting movies , a clockwork orange violently takes on the ideas of morality and sensitivity . while the obscene scenes ( which helped to ban the movie for a couple of decades ) show how the main character becomes too sensitive to like crime and rape , the viewer becomes desensitized , and vice versa . this movie also shows how evil impulses transcends who people seem to be .
positive	this movie includes one of the great court scenes ever done in a movie . i'm can handle the truth : this movie was fantastic .
negative	beyond stupid , i regret taking my kids to see this lame movie . disney can do better than this !
negative	what kind of plot was this ? besides predictability and a cliched storyline , the story went nowhere . fx did not save this movie . poor acting too .
negative	i can not believe that this picture got best picture ! i hadn't seen it before then so had to go rent it . i was enormously disappointed . this movie is about as highly rated as magnolia . both movies suck'
positive	i love this movie . i can't think of the main charters name but she is bomb .
positive	this movie was brilliantly made and could go either way . either you love it or you hate it . even those who say they hate it won't dare take there eyes off of it from beginning to end . one of the greatest movies i ever saw .
positive	he helped draft the port huron statement and was a roadie for metallica ! that summed up the dude's accomplishments . what a great flick !
positive	i love save the last dance , whoever hasn't seen it need to go see it , trust me you will love it . save the last dance is the best movie i've ever seen , i love julia stiles and sean patrick thomas . i made a list of my 10 best and favorite movies and save the last dance is # 1 on my list . you won't be sorry when you go see it , save the last dance is the best movie of all time .
positive	nemesis epitomizes how a trek movie should be ! starting off with the classic star trek the next generation theme against a background of moving stars , you know you are in for a great motion picture ! the special effects are awesome and even beat the ones found in first contact and insurrection . the awesome cast of actors could show tom cruise , vin diesel and other overrated dramatic actors a good lesson in how to act . the plot is great and has a lot of mind games , just as a trek plot should . there are some awesome touches of continuity : from previous events , characters from deep space nine and voyager ( ! ! ! ! ) , old friends dropping by , other alien races from past adventures and more . the action sequences are so much better than james bond , xxx , mission impossible and others that its not even funny . rivaling wrath of khan and first contact for best trek movie ever , i gladly give nemesis five out of five stars ! !
positive	excellent special effects . i like the story , but i didn't understand why they named the movie romeo must die .
positive	very funny movie about a man who takes his job very serious in being a waterboy .
negative	unless you enjoy watching a grumpy , drunk , jerk say the f word every 5 minutes , then i do not recommend this movie . billy bob plays such a miserable character it makes the movie painful to watch . then in the last scene when he tries to redeem himself its too little too late , and seems way too unlikely that such a loser would finally develope any sort of compassion . dont waste your time .
positive	best movie ever ! !
positive	best movie ever ! !
positive	this story takes place in the nineteenth century in a little town in france named lourdes . bernadette is a peasant girl who sees a vision of the blessed virgin mary . she experiences a lot of suffering because of her chosen status as a messenger of the holy virgin . her family also bore some ridicule as a result . there is much drama involved , and miracles are depicted . vincent price has a strong role as a cynic . one miracle was reported in the press of the day , and it involved the lourdes grotto onlookers becoming soaking wet from a downpour ; when suddenly , the sun appeared and seemed to be heading straight toward the earth . people reportedly were hysterical , and naturally , many promised to change their lives . then the sun stopped its direction , and returned to its position in the sky . the movie was a smash hit in 1943 , and its lead actress , jennifer jones , won the academy award for best actress . there are powerful performances in the supporting categories , which earned oscar nominations for gladys cooper , anne revere and charles bickford . the director , henry king also was a nominee , as was the film . " the song of bernadette " wound up with 12 oscar nominations . it won in several categories .
positive	best holiday movie ever ! ! one of the few movies that gets me choked up at the end ! !
positive	coop is an american fighting for the reds in republican spain in this rendition of the hemingway novel . ingrid begman is lovely , but casting her as a spaniard ?
positive	walken is super in this made-for-him role . a disturbing picture with the viewer finding themselves hurting for johnny . the music score is super and this movie is compelling and chilling at times . great movie .
positive	princess bride was a wonderful fantasy movie . it had everything a good story should have- humor , romance , adventure , and surprises . princess bride was superbly acted and the characters lived on the screen . more movies like this need to be made . it is a movie children and adults both can love .
negative	mira sorvino wonders why her career went downhill ?
positive	well , just call me simple and dull but i liked this movie . i just got a kick out of the sweet character finding himself in so many experiences and he never realized how diverse these things were . i also loved his attitude of never thinking he was more than he was . what in the world can be wrong with a story of a sweet , kind man in some extremely funny and sometimes sad moments .
positive	stupid crude disgusting adolescent humor . i give it 5-stars .
negative	swiss family robinson was the most boring disney feature i have ever gone through in my life . it was a very bad experience watching this film , as it tried mixing the sound of music with gilligan's island . nope , it didn't work walt .
positive	so much better than that cinematic tripe from baz luhrman . . .
positive	great movie . the final scenes of the movie are fabulous . i even liked the baldwin brother in this movie .
positive	one of the best movies of the summer ! great cast with equally great plot . just incredible .
positive	the more time goes by , the better this movie seems . although rooted in -- and inspired by -- the cold war and mccarthyism , robert wise's neat , unpretentious tale is truly timeless . fine performances by michael rennie , patricia neal , and sam jaffe-- plus gort , one of the great robots in film history .
positive	this is a hoot--puncturing the righteous folk music fad . i suppose most of you don't remember the folk music craze of the 1950's and 1960's . lucky you ! lots of scrubbed up and later scruffy music cranks strummed and hummed and bummed their way around the country warbling about oppression and recession and depression and regression and obsession , ad naseum . this movie skewers the kingston trio , ian and sylvian and others . it is great fun . ( i have an admission to make . i rather liked the folk era ! )
negative	although it has one or 2 amusing moments , it again turns too raunchy for its own good and has distatesful visual gags , too many sex jokes and too much profanity . about the only light are the occasionally-amusing parents , who swim in and out of tasteful and yucky . the acting is still sub-par , except for the father , and the plot is innane . avoid this movie !
positive	best comedy ever , but i also need to know if anyone remembers what song is playing when their getting ready for the prom soilentgreen @ box . com
negative	the movie is rather bland , with sparse moments of weak laughter to break the drawn out moments of predictable and dull events . i was all hyped up by the commercials that looked so promising , and then utterly disappointed when i left the theater ( which i shouldnt have even entered ) after 115 minutes of infantilizing ( and somewhat sleazy ) humor and awkward , repetitious dialogue ( ok , i get it 8 out of 10 women think that the first kiss is important . let it go already ) . youd think a movie with will smith and kevin james would be hilarious , but not even the best of actors can make this clich laden script work on the screen . best see another movie instead .
positive	now , first of all , i'd like to say that i liked this movie . i think it didn't deserve to be bashed by critics . it really only got 1 star , but now you know what all the people think . i think this was a very creative comedy .
positive	shirley eaton is fabulous .
positive	so bizarre . candy man one of my alltime favorite songs . the tunnel scene is one of the scariest moments in all of film .
positive	this wasn't a huge blockbuster , but i know many people who regard this as their favorite movie of all-time . it has it all : dry humor , a love story , action . andre the giant deserved oscar consideration .
positive	the first nightmare takes the cake ! the kid being drug across the ceiling was fabuloso ! also the girl in the body bag being drug through the hall of the school during the day ! this still scares the living s @ # t out of me , and i have seen a ton of horror films in my 38 yr . s this is the best to date . . . just don't go to sleep !
positive	wonderful , vivid , and heart-wrenching . it's a lot better than george stevens' " the greatest story ever told . "
positive	i wish this movie would have been hours longer . the story was compelling as was the love between them . i think that in our american history books we glorify people and gloss over reality in exchange for heroes . this movie showed what i believe was a much more accurate description of the average soldier , ignorant and narrow-minded . this movie was a masterpiece !
positive	awesome movie . i really wanted saburo to live though . maybe its better that he didnt . i really suggest it for the foriegn movie fan .
positive	i enjoyed this movie . shawshank redemption was very well developed . they put a lot of time into developing each character . it held my attention until the end and had a very unique ending . i would definitely recommend it .
positive	as a fast car nut , i had goose pimples when eleanor started up . the movie was outrageous . all i have to say is when is the sequel ? ? ? ? ?
positive	grease was a fun movie to watch . i loved the music and dancing in it .
positive	grat move to just have a laugh
positive	when harry met sally . . . is the perfect romantic comedy . meg ryan and billy crystal are terrific in their roles , and the supporting cast members ( bruno kirby and carrie fisher ) add a lot to the show . surprisingly enough , the movie isn't too sappy and sentimental . even my husband ( who's quick to use the term chick flick ) likes this one . there are lots of great scenes- like the car ride to new york , the meal in the diner where meg ryan really enjoys her food , and the new year's eve parties . i also love the scenes of new york , especially the ones in central park , because they make the city look so attractive . since everything about this movie is entertaining , i usually end up watching it once a year .
positive	in a time long ago . . . in a galaxy far away . . .
positive	a magnificent cinematic achievement . for those who find it too long or have trouble reading the subtitles , i recommend watching the u . s . remake the magnificent seven the day before . the plots are similar enough and kurosawas direction and the casts acting is so good that if you have difficulty with the subtitles you won't lose track .
negative	this whole fake documentary was all made up by michael moore . check out this website ! bowlingfortruth . com
positive	to kill a monkingbird was a great movie . it stuck pretty close to the novel it was based on . it blended characters from the book and totally left out one but otherwise it was a great movie focusing on the problems of the time .
positive	this was such a great movie ! i loved it . it was sweet and it kind of relates to how girls act when they are young and will do anything to be popular . but in this movie , it proves that bening popular isn't the best thing you can have and that you should stick with your true friends . this movie showed a message and it was great ! if you haven't seen this movie , it is a definite movie that you should go see
positive	my favourite musical , in fact one of the few i like . performed on stage its great , and the screen version captures much of the theatrical charm , although the casting is less than perfect . the opening number fugue for tinhorns is one the best moments in any movie musical .
positive	john waters is truly one of the best out there in the entertainment industry . this musical of a movie was so cute , i truly enjoyed it . ricki lake also did a great job in this movie . i highly recommend it to john waters fans and musical fans alike .
positive	this movie is the greatest comedy horror movie ever made . they combine cheesy horror with lots of slapstick comedy . there may not be much of a plot but it still keeps your attention . all together a good movie .
positive	a great action movie . lots of great one-liners , cool explosions , and a good plot . bruce willis is the man .
positive	the best film of this genre , it set the bar high for many films to follow of life in the inner-city . great acting by cuba gooding , but even better by laurence fishborne and ice-cube . very moving .
positive	i watched the sound of music innumerable times when i was younger . the songs are classic and scenes from the movie puts the viewers in a trance . this music movie is definitely a family movie .
negative	blah .
positive	i have recently seen pearl harbour and i enjoyed the whole movie . the attack on pearl harbour was thought out very well by the japanese . a day never to be forgotten .
positive	russell crowe can flat-out act . jennifer connelly gives an exceptionally fine performance as well .
positive	i think , although i am slightly biased to comment on this film because i am jewish , you can not argu the fact that it is a powerful film , and filled with bold statements such as the girl in the red coat that appears at certain moments , but the film its self , which ( forgetting what it stands for alone ) is so well crafted , directed and acted , the fact that it is based on the holocaust is irrelevant , because it is so amazingly powerful , gripping , and truly amazing . a film i will always watch !
positive	probably in my top 3 horror flicks of all time . this movie will scare the bejesus out of people who watch it for the first time . timeless horror scenes , suspense , and mystery . john carpenter is the man when it comes to horror . i highly recommend this to anybody's collection .
positive	madness can be brutal . especially in the hands of god or kubrick as most call him . this is his only true horror film . not in the since of halloween or friday the 13th . but as a film dealing with the frailty of the mind and age old precsence of evil . jack is on scary sob . i think this a timeless epic horror film . it will be cherished as a classic for years to come . thank you kubrick !
positive	gotta see it . it is old but very cool .
positive	one of my favourite films as a child - it's still surprisingly original ! i liked the different personality to each animal the difficulties they had to face : especially the river ! funny warm ! : - )
positive	omg how can u call it a children's bore ? ! it waz an awesome movie and the actorz and actressez rocked ! of course , the best waz khleo thomas ! ! : - ) and i mean even though khleo ( khaleed leon ) thomas improved the movie a lot ( he'z so hott and such a great actor ! ) , it would have been great even without him ! the plot is really exciting and it'z amazing how it all tiez together . it had an advantage because the author of the original book ( which waz great , too ) wrote the screenplay . all in all , the acting waz awesome and the movie waz well written !
positive	classic , a first in the genre , and one of the best .
negative	this movie is horrible . i am not sure what the other people on this page were smoking when they saw it , but they must have been out of their mind . the writing was horrible , the plot was predictable and uninteresting . for most of the movie i was hoping that the machines would win and kill all of these whining pathetic characters . this movie was a greater dissapointment than star wars episode i . everything that was good about the first two movies was absent from this one .
positive	great movie . james stewart is a photographer who is apartment bound when he has a broken leg . he passes time by watching his neighbors in other apartments . he gets suspicious of one neighbor when he is convinced he has killed his wife . he gets his girlfriend involved . and suspense follows . in trying to get others to believe what he saw . good suspense movie directed by alfred hitchcock .
positive	great movie and not boring . bob sagets performance is a + ! bloopers were great at the end of the movie .
positive	great performances ! great music ! great story ! briliant movie !
negative	10 year olds could have come up with a better plot , and i got really sick of all the cgi shots of the exteriors of the buildings in the main city .
negative	after the first hour and 1 / 2 , i was rooting for the iceberg .
positive	one of the best movies i have ever seen . great acting , great show
positive	a little better than braveheart . and since gladiator was fiction at least you didn't know what the ending was .
positive	this is an awesome movie . nothing happens ? actually a lot happens . this is a realistic movie , not charlie's angels . plot : a struggling alcholic writer and his soon to be married friend go an a bachelor party trip through the california wine country . this movie explores two middle age failures . it is very funny .
positive	an incredible science-fiction adventure . this movie has everything : good defeating evil , humorous dialogue , great characters , good special effects and more . a classic .
positive	cornelius ryan's book on film does a good job about d day . i always enjoyed watching to see which of the many stars would appear next . just about everbody who was anybody in film at the time was in this flick .
positive	i own the boxset , the definitive one with 8 disks . i have loved the films as a child , and i do to this day , the original is the stand-out , but three and new nightmare come in close second , and the rest have a place in my heart as well . i also love robert englund ( freddy ) .
positive	one of the best action movies ever made .
positive	a true commentary on the duality of the sexes . just brilliant !
positive	there are many great films out there , but i can only be sure of three that are the greatest of all-time . citizen kane is one of them . there is no way that you can over-estimate the influence this film has had on movies . from its revolutionary narrative structure to its immensely innovative camera tricks , kane offered a glimpse into the real world at a time when films were still creating alternate ones . orson welles was truly a visionary . he , along with such greats as alfred hitchcock , john ford and d . w . griffith perfected the motion picture , made it an art form and fashioned it into what it has evolved into today . citizen kane is the greatest film ever made .
negative	a pathetic attempt to exploit religion and make a movie . poo .
positive	this movie is a masterpiece , plain and simple . very beautiful scenery and effects , and a well thought-out and well acted storyline . i also like how the movie doesn't have an actual chapter ending just like the book . the main ending will come at the end of the third one . it's kind of different from star wars where they would have an actual chapter ending at the end of each movie . it is also very detailed when it comes to every character ( appearance and background ) , history , the world of role playing ( or realm of rp . however you put it ) , and of course the book itself . . if you haven't seen it , go see it ! ! ! !
positive	the director decided to make fun of all the movies from scream and i know what you did last summer . the movie is so funny because they switch the whole theme about it . they even made fun of the sixth sense and thought he was smoking something that made him see dead people .
positive	david lynch is great ! !
positive	was pleasnatly surprised how the movie turned out ! ! was very entertained and thought it was david spades best so far
negative	legend of uncle tom , more like .
positive	excellent movie with a unique plot and great actors . kevin spacey is seen to be slightly mental in the beginnning and not likable , as well . yet , as the movie continues , he is a great character whom you feel for .
positive	a very powerful movie . not for the young . it doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the way skinheads and the neo-nazi's in the country spread their hate . this film is about a skinhead who goes to prison for killing a black guy . while in prison his younger brother gets involved with the skinheads . when he gets out of prison the older brother ( ed norton ) trys to get him away from that . he's been rehabilitated . i've watched it 3 times and the ending still gets to me . a must see for anyone over 14 . i'd advise young people to see it with an adult , preferably their parent if they can . it's a pretty strong movie . ed norton has to be one of the best actors of our time .
positive	adrian !
positive	all hail the real godzilla ! ! ! ! !
positive	i searched for this movie high and low - finally got it ( on video ) . my daughters enjoy jackie's movies very much . this one is my favorite . i laughed throughout the whole movie . jackie and owen should go for another great movie like this one . i especially like the no sexual scenes , no ( excessive ) abusive speech . thanks
positive	great movie ! it should have been called dogs cats . dogs are so much better , imho . sean hayes was great as mr tinkles .
positive	yet again , another film by tarintino seeping with style and finesse . his editing and storylines are absolutely seamless - he effortlessly moves the plot from the past to the present , from one characters perspective to another to the point where its a work of art . and samuel jackson just radiates cool .
positive	stiller is one of the funniest people around , and deniro is a great comic actor . the whole story is great , and i cant wait for the sequel .
negative	please , hand me the air-sickness bag . a stupid turd of nostalgia featuring two of the absolutely worst leads ever to disgrace the screen . olivia newton-john sure looks good in this one , but as usual , sings like she's got a clothespin on her nose . john ravolta puts in another oily and unconvincing gooch performance , singing like a frog in rut , and twitching around in that disconcerting manner of his . the songs are juvenile claptrap . the dancing is predictable and hardly memorable . the script is moronic . otherwise , this is a great flick ! ! !
positive	one of the best horror films i have ever seen . suspence is scary not blood a must see for all movie fans ecpecailly horror fans .
positive	a war movie . twelve excons form a group called the dirty dozen to execute a suicide mission in the heart of nazi germany during world war ii . humorous and witty dialogue . the excons become human beings again . one of the greatest war movies of all time with great acting , plot and dialogue .
positive	this movie was awesome . the story was so interesting because of the historical aspects and the acting was really good . . . plus it had a lot of humor . it was clever and intense , and i'd watch it again in a heartbeat .
positive	this movie was wonderful . it was full of suspense . the story was flowing and it never dragged on . usually during most of the scary movies i've seen , they weren't as scary as i thought they would be . this movie actually fulfilled my expectations of a scary movie . it's my favorite movie as of now .
negative	would someone tell me why a reality movie was made ? for , i have no clue .
negative	other than the original , none of the others justify more than a 1 .
positive	wow is this a depressing movie . sometimes you want get bummed out , and this is just the movie to do it . i remember hearing that this was x rated when it won best picture in 1969 or so . its tough to imagine why it got that rating . i can only imagine how disappointing some rowdy young adults were when they went to see an adult movie and got this heart wrenching arty drama instead . kinda like when bart simpson's pals were headed off to see an r rated movie , chanting bar-ton-fink ! bar-ton-fink ! , not knowing what was in store for them . . . .
positive	a great film . it explores ideas of sexuality and celeberity in a fun and light-hearted way . john malkovich's capacity for weirdness is used to great puppeteering effect . john cusak is always great , here as a loser tortured by unequated love . cameron diaz is almost unrecognizable , but the sweetness of her character shines through . the ending is brilliant .
positive	terrific movie ! you actually can feel what james caviezal is going through and by the end of the movie you will want the revenge just as bad as he does . i like this movie so much because the revenge is clever and carefully planned , unlike every other movie where a guy just gets a gun and starts killing everyone , but this is very clever and the actors do a terrific job on opposite ends of each other .
positive	although not the computer-generated perfection that was toy story 2 , finding nemo is just plain great . the character of dory gets a laugh from every line of her dialogue . and , then , there is the hilarious scenes in the dentist office and the seagulls . i have to ask though : if this is a pixar film , where are the outtakes ?
positive	a very hilarious movie . ben stiller to do other types of movies though .
negative	i'd rather watch 90 minutes of previews .
positive	an absolutely beautiful movie . the directing impresses me to an undying end .
positive	a beautiful film , crafted by a master - kieslowski . a polish director working in france , tells a story through the eyes of juliette binoche's character , a woman who has lost her husband and child in a terrible car accident . it deals with her grief and how she rebuilds her life . the music is outstanding .
negative	this one doesn't have a thing to do with michael myers , and it sucks . but it doesn't suck because he's not in it , it sucks because it sucks ! i mean , it's really bad . it's not scary , it's just plain bad . the people who made this film must have had some serious issues with children . it didn't scare me at all , just left me with a bad feeling .
positive	this is the best movie in the world . why is it ranked with she's all that and notting hill not only are the characters down to realistic , but they're hilarious ! brodie bruce is my hero . his sarcastic wit is so perfect . i laugh harder everytime i see it . jay and silent bob are the real american badasses ! their scemes are just so well worked out . the girls did well , and not's forget t . s . . i recommend this movie and a big donut . kudos to the cast . mr . jason lee , you rock ! words cannot express the love i have of this movie . i watch it every day !
negative	worst movie i have seen in years . a bunch of legendary actors gather together into whqat would be a great movie if it were about something completely different . donald sutherland is one of the greatest to grace the planet but not even he could save this terrible movie .
positive	my favorite movie as a child . i loved the songs .
positive	independence day is the end-all of sci-fi movies . the representation of the aliens disputes on the old big-eyed , grey-skinned theory . the plot is somewhat predictable but twists occur when they are least expected . all in all , independence day is a must-see for the true sci-fi fan .
negative	this movie is a shocker , and totally one hundered pecent not scary . i am 9 year old boy and this is poo . if anything , hilarious especially the girl going down the stairs . the omen is far better !
negative	i see piano gets several oscars . i guess if you make a film about the holocaust you are guaranteed an oscar . gee , what a surprise .
positive	adam sandler is hilarious !
negative	this movie was disturbing . the effects were pretty good but that didn't make up for the terrible plot .
positive	entirely entertaining . callmetootie is my nemesis .
positive	this should be in a romantic drama category , but it should also be in the top 20 . an excellent story with great actors .
positive	goodfella's is one of my favorite movies . it is well writeen and well acted by robert diniro and joe pesci . it is a classic gangster movie that everyone should see .
positive	best movie i have seen since titanic . should be required for all young people to get a brief understanding of the sacrifices made by the people who founded this country . i applaud mel gibson for making a film with such strong conservative values .
positive	great movie . very good story . shows very harsh reality in the ghettos of rio .
positive	hey , im only 15 and i think seven samurai is the best film ever . i wish more people my age would watch it . i would hate for this film to be dubbed , it would take all its charm away . everyone should stop whining about how long it is and how much reading there is . first of all , to fit all that great story into a movie , it has to be long . second , if you dont like reading all that , to bad , you probly need to read more anyways . i give this movie an a + , go ahead and find a better foriegn movie , i dare you . . .
positive	the storyline was great and i feel it pleased both the male and female crowds . i really liked it .
positive	fight club is the best movie ever created .
negative	why oh why did they make this movie ?
positive	'the' best musical ever made
positive	casablanca was one of the classics never to be forgotten . its quotes and scenes will live forever . keep playin' it again sam . . .
negative	this is stupid how could you compare this to halloween this was not even a slasher it is almost is nothing like halloween and john carpenter even said he never heard of black christmas until years after halloween this movie is verry unsuccfull and verry unpopular how can you compare this with halloween it is like comparing fast food with gorme food watch halloween
negative	i would like to share my opinion . . . . i bought the first bw video before renting an saw it because my brother age 19 at the time said it was good it scared him to death well to be honest i hated it , i was so furious about how bad it sucked , in all my life ive never seen a movie more worse then that . . . . . so im extremely reluctant to even seeing the second one yet just earlier last year i did a little research an im not sure yet til i have proof to back this up but it could very well be that the first bw wasnt a movie , it was a real film documentary , suppose to be realistic , real life not fake . . . . . once i have actual proof of this ill share it with you all . . . . . after seeing the first one i did get online an write to anyone i could regarding this movie an expressed my complete regretfulness for even buying the movie , expressed how horrible i felt it was . . . .
positive	my all time favorite movie . hilarious from start to finish with a great ending by neil taking in dell for thanksgiving . a definite pick me up type movie .
negative	stupid movie . not worthy of the disney family .
positive	it surpassed my expectations . the cgi was well done as were the fight scenes . the comic book movie genre has been ressurected with the sucess of x-men . so that explains the sudden boom of comic book movies . ben affleck gave a surprising performance in this movie and i don't think it's fair to judge a whole movie based solely on one's grudge against ben affleck .
negative	this movie was actually more retarded than i had expected . the scene with the coconuts and hurleys tits was like huh , are you fugging serious ! south park is 1000 times more stupid and crude and funny than this piece of dumbsh * t . in fact , mike myers is only funny in snl . hyperhypo , man . now thats funny , harharharhar . . . . . youpatheticfools .
positive	original , gripping , moving , fun ! tom hanks was incredible .
positive	this one scared me . i enjoyed it very much . worth seening more than ounce if you enjoy a truly scary movie .
positive	so who was this bob fosse ? he was selfish , cynical and remarkably sensitive -- another artist who could get away with being hateful because of his ability to see and create beauty , because of his awareness . but then american critics too get away with a hell of a lot these days . they dump their opinions on the page and forget to clean them up . i havent read one critique yet that pointed out that the film is postmodern ! all that jazz is post-modern and post-modern was the perfect medium for fosse : its skeptical , unreligious , unaccountable and playful . bob fosses outer life , apparently , was the same way , and his inner life , more complicated than that and deeper , is given to us in pieces . he lets you experience his life without actually spelling it out for you ( he spells out a great deal in hard words about himself but many things are only hinted at ) . this , again , is what critics seem to miss that the so-called flaws in the film might be necessary because they add to its complexity and contradictory nature and because theres more to bob fosse than womanizer , addict , workaholic . its supposed to be tongue-in-cheek ! its supposed to be tedious in parts and riveting / haunting in others ! thats the way the life hes describing is . theres no way fosse would have intended the film to be perfect in a hollywood way . he wanted it to be perfect in an artistic way subtle , uneven , light , funny , a little silly , and deeply disturbing . that is the formula for a perfect art film , the perfect art film being what most accurately reflects real life . according to several american critics , the film is self-indulgent , annoying in parts , and too long . to them a film is a product , something for their gratification . they look up at the screen without looking up at the film unless , of course , it does something for them -- thrills , delights , makes them cry at just the right moments . they are used to so many commercials and commercials are usually thrilling and sentimental . the majority of online reviews seem to think theres something gracious and magnanimous about granting that all that jazz is unique and moving in some way and leave it at that : great choreography , intriguing performances , impressive attempt . this is due not to a lack of intelligence of the reviewers but , apparently , their lack of interest in the deeper subject matter .
positive	as far as entertainment goes , both scream movies are pretty much neck and neck . but the best film of the two is definately this one ! this is the perfect example of what a modern-day horror movie is all about . along with silence of the lambs scream , this is probably one of the best horror movies of the 90s , if you ask me .
positive	extremly funny sequel .
positive	one of my all time favorites . people keep asking who would have made a better willy wonka than johnny depp in the new version . may i suggest crispin glover ? think about it . he has that sort of creepy look that wilder has . hell , he's creepy period . would have been great !
negative	i would probably like this movie if i didn't have a penis .
positive	this movie is very funny theres not much i can say about it except that its funny as hell i think that was the best movie of 2004
positive	i gave jerry maguire a 5 because it's such a great movie . tom cruise does so well in it . he is such a great actor . also the plot of the movie is good because it is based on true life events . it also has a really good storyline .
positive	i luv this movie . it is really awesome just like bring it on !
positive	private detective philip marlowe is hired to investigate an extortion mystery affecting a wealthy elderly general and his two daughters . brilliant essential 40's film noir ; an unmissable chance to wallow in the bogie-bacall magic , the electric ( raymond chandler and william faulkner ! ) dialogue , fizzing sexual chemistry , labyrinthine plot , atmospheric photography and marvellous howard hawks direction .
positive	this was an interesting and excellent film . it kept my attention throughout the film , and the ending was fantastic and unexpected . this was a great movie , though not 100 % horror . i recommend this movie to everybody .
positive	i thought this movie was a great representation of how difficult it is to make it big from nothing , and how culture clashes with getting out and being a pop star . the movie is very entertaining and the music , of course , is wonderful .
positive	scary and good
positive	i loved it
positive	george lucas sent the series out in style . all the pieces of the puzzle come together . no stones left unturned . while the first two were a little lackluster , lucas hit one out of the park with episode 3 . lots of action , a little romance , a touch of horror and some shocking moments as well . 5 huge stars and two big thumbs way up !
positive	great music . good fun . clean enjoyable entertainment
negative	wow really dissapointed : (
positive	tremendous flick . just love it .
positive	i give this film five stars mainly for the acting ( especially on the part of the wonderfully talented young leo dicaprio ) and the art direction . the two young leads are so alive and their passion for one another seems so real . watch out for the two young lead actors because they are the ones that truly make this film what it is .
positive	this should definatly be higher on the list . this is an awsome m . night shaymalan movie . i've watched this movie many times and i still enjoy every minute of it . shaymalan proves you can have an exciting movie without overusing cgi in a film . this movie is awsome to watch .
positive	i wouldn't have called it a comedy , but i loved it . . .
positive	this was a great movie which just left me in suspense . it was a well thought out story and it couldn't have had a better ending .
positive	hysterical and cute !
negative	way too far fetched . the judge had a roller coaster in his back yard , enough said .
negative	the title refers to the intelligence of the people who give it 5 stars .
negative	i gave this movie a rating of 1 because it was not interesting or appealing to my best interest . throughout the movie i constantly was falling asleep .
positive	yet another man who got what he deserved . i sound like a man hater . more torture would have been good though .
positive	great movie ! ! ! even better book ! ! what was scarlett thinking when she realized it was rhett she wanted and not ashley ?
positive	one of al pachino's best roles . absolutely wonderful ! !
negative	this movie failed on all levels with me . first of all , if you've seen the ring , nothing in this movie will surprise you . samara isn't nearly as scary in this one as in the first one . it was far to easy to tell when it was aiden , or samara in the possession scenes , and i didn't think rachel's acting was particularly good at any point in the movie . the special effects in this film are pretty much what you got in the first one , no surprises there . there are two good effects moments , though . the deer attacking the car ( why didn't rachel just listen to aiden and keep driving ? ) and the bathtub scene ( why didn't rachel listen to aiden when he said he didn't want to take a bath ? ) . those two scenes were the highlight of an otherwise dull and unremarkable film . skip it .
positive	jamie lee's debut and as a great scream queen . this slasher was really scary . it idea of an unstoppable boogey-man is truly frightening . this is one of john carpenter's good ones .
positive	arnold kicking alien butt !
positive	wonderful movie , despite the gore . b g ( blood guts ) seem to be an integral part of films now , and i think it heightens the realism . crowe , phoenix , reed , nielsen and harris did a fabulous job in this . i recommend it to anyone who has the stomach for innate realism . way better than patriot . ( sorry melfans . . . )
positive	i watched this movie again a year or so ago and it was still great . by now , everyone has probably seen it , but if you haven't seen it in a while , do yourself a favor and rent it . you won't be disappointed .
positive	very real . after the movie ends , you're left with a those five bucks were well spent feeling , and you know that this could happen in real life . i didn't like the ending at first , but then understood why they did it . i'll give it a five even though i think it deserves a 4 . 8 ( considering the fact that it wasn't the best , though it was really good ) .
positive	a great movie from the late nineties about smoking pot . . . chapelle is the man for here and today !
negative	embarrasingly bad .
positive	tom hank's best performance . i don't know if he was retarded or not . i hope they have a sequel .
negative	this movie was , like , totally boring . who wants to watch a talentless crone smoking cigarettes and prostituting herself ?
positive	another bill murray classic ! humor is a mix of slapstick and dialogue . the plot is a good one , and it is obvious why two more sequels were made plus the well-executed comic spinoffs . the remaineder of the cast is well-rounded and the laughs keep coming . highly recommended !
positive	that movie was hilarious . you gotta love the little kid .
negative	i'm loving this bulshit . its troops like the ones in iraq and overseas that make it possible for a fat lard like moore to make a flick like this . just disgrace . it is unbelieveable how people can go along with liberal propaganda and believe that bush is in iraq for his personal reasons . get a clue and realize that we did not elect a president who is so foolish . as fheit as a movie , poor insight with one sided views . whomever made this movie needs to kill yourself . we love you michael moore . keep putting out bad movies because the republican party loves to bash your liberal propaganda . just remember who controls the senate . bill frist .
positive	the first war film i've ever seen . it was exciting . this was this first movie at which my eyes actually started watering .
positive	i try to carefully say this about this film because i realize it is not easy to characterize any of the classics in this manner : quite possibly the best american film ever written and produced .
positive	oh . . . . . this one was way funnier than the first one .
negative	dumb , dumb and dummer . don't seem to see the director making anything these days so maybe there is some justice in the world . a rip-off , super 35mm is just another version of the cheap superscope that came out in the 1950's . only good fim shoot in that process was vera cruz .
positive	this is the best ( and really for me , the only ) that belushi has ever done very well . everything about this movie made sense and connected well . they also didn't add a deep love story , which for this movie was good .
positive	the snozberries taste like snozberries .
negative	a horrible movie about a man with a pefect life who hates it so much he pretends to be others and murders people in gruesome fashion . redeeming factor- threesome with two girls .
positive	for those who love to relive the fantasies and experience the heroic deeds , this is a must .
positive	what a masterpiece . first , there is a tremendous cast . . . marlon brando , al pacino , james caan , robert duvall . each of the actors puts in a performance of a lifetime . second , the storyline is so compelling and well written . right in front of your eyes , michael corleone changes from the innocent , young soldier into the head of the family . third , the movie made the mafia a part of popular culture and paved the way for future movies and tv shows in the genre . if you haven't seen this movie , you are only hurting yourself . it is wonderful .
positive	yellow submarine by the beatles is the best . they are the best smoking out music . my dad got me into the beatles .
positive	wow . dustin hoffman did an excelent job . this is another actor who can be whatever he wants to be . wasn't it he who dressed up as a woman for one of his movies ? that's what i admire most about the guy . he can switch from one character to another so easily . i think this movie really showed his talent to the public . wonderful , wonderful . p . s . -edward norton can do an excelent immitation of dustin hoffman in the rain man . . .
positive	what can i say ? aardman says it all . absolutely the best of the domestic productions
positive	do you find something humouwous abowt my fwiend , bigus dickus ?
positive	the greatness of the film , for me , is demonstrated by the fact that i'm not religious , i find the premise absurd ( john landis made the comment , and i paraphrase , 12-year old girl gets possessed by the devil and goes to pedophile priests for assistance ? ) , and yet i still love it . stars the great ellen burstyn and max von sydow and even non-actor ( playwright ) jason miller is effective . greatest of all , of course , is the make-up by dick smith . despite all the advances in make-up and special effects that have been made in the years since 1973 , this creation has never been matched in terms of sheer , chilling creepiness . this is the kind of no-holds barred movie they just don't make anymore , unfortunately . can you imagine anyone putting a scene like the one with linda blair and the crucifix in a film today ? put this one up against the pitiful pseudo-exorcist movie that came out last year , and you'll see how markedly the state of moviemaking has deteriorated over the past 20-30 years .
positive	more than just a horror flick - more than a great horror film - speaks volumes about society . absolute classic . every time she screams in panic when looking at him i'm on the monster's side -whenever villagers run in fear - i'm on his side ! it's entirely unrational , but i can't help it - rejection hurts !
negative	lopez has no talent .
positive	a slightly above average war movie . m * a * s * h is based on the true life experience of the author . he was a real doctor in a m * a * s * h unit in korea . the book reads like a newpaper account of the antics of the unit . fortunatly , the screenplay is much , much better than the novel . elliot gould , donald sutherland and tom skerrit all are terrific as the draftee doctors . only gary burgoff as radr made the transition from movie to tv series . the movie was based in korea , but robert altman wanted to make a point about the war in vietnam , and have the audience thnk about vietnam , so korea is mentioned only sparingly throughout the movie . it doesn't matter which war the movie is set in , it is a biting indicment against war , and tha maddness which causes it .
negative	don't watch this movie , waste of money . don't rent this movie , waste of money . all the good scenes are already in the previews .
negative	more of a propoganda film that anything else . i'm a liberal , but i hate when my fellow liberals churn out false propoganda to brainwash the masses . same for republicans and other politicians . michael moore may be a smart man , but he doesn't depict himself properly when all he does is piss and moan about one problem instead of adressing every aspect of it . for one thing , michael moore only adresses 4 countries in the world about gun violence . look at some places in the middle east . gun violence is worse there than america . we ought to go there and try and help those poor kids there . michael moore also spins some things out of control . some of the links he makes between gun violence and what causes it . . . . . . . jeez . in my opinion , what causes gun violence is poverty and overcrowding which also causes mental instability among many .
negative	this movie sucked ass .
positive	this was a great movie about love . basketball was just something that the characters did to pass time . i really enjoyed it and , in fact , went to the movies to see it several times .
positive	most original thing , i've seen in awhile .
positive	this was a great movie about life in the ghetto and the realness of a black man in the hood . but what made this movie stand out is how trey's father was hard on him and he was the only one to make it out of the hood .
positive	two words . . . very funny !
positive	beautiful mind is a beautiful movie . the story of john nash , in itself , is fascinating . but russell crowe's protrayal is a stellar piece of acting . crowe would have gotten his second straight oscar for that role , had it not been for an episode of behaving badly to a film exec just before the oscars . jennifer connelly is goddess-like in this film . her oscar is well deserved . scott glenn , as always , excels . the movie depicts the horrors of going through life as a paranoid schizophrenic . nash's eventual triumph is overwhelmingly emotional . my favorite parts of the movie is when nash is cogent and lucid . he was a genius of the highest magnitude . the way the movie demonstrated his nobel prize winning theory of economic equilibrium ( using the example of picking up women at bars ) was one of the neatest things i've seen in the movies .
positive	this is my fav movie . bill murray's best role i belive . his transision from being a stressed out reporter to a man at his full potential , and in the end he gets his girl , i watch this movie like an addiction and of course i watch it on groundhogs day . don't drive angery -bill murray
negative	what is funny about this movie ? ok , first screwball comedy ever but it's not funny ! how could anyone possibly laugh ? ? ? ? ? most overrated movie of the 30s , one of the most . . . ever . very good movie though .
positive	this is an awesome movie ! in fact i watched it today and laughed my head off . what a wonderful team matthau and lemmon make . i will miss their work trememdously .
positive	while this movie falls into the category of scifi , it uses other elements to tell it's story . each character is developed through dialogue and action . there is not a feeling of anything unnecessary occuring , everything has a place and a reason .
negative	i'm still on planet earth right ? ! ? ! ? hello ! ! people work with me here . where to begin , where to begin . how 'bout i walked out of this film in the first half hour and demanded my money back ! i couldn't believe what a parody this was of the first one . i didn't think the first one was fantastic but at least it stayed in line with the type of visuals , acting , and suspense of the show . this thing was just a non-stop oh my god is this cheesey scene after another . when he's rock climbing and jumps 20 feet and down to his right and slides down the rock face until he suddenly grips a protrubing pebble ? ! ! ? then he decides to turn himself around and hang for a couple of minutes while he stares off into space with a goddamn i'm cool look on his face . or the bathtub scene , or the dance floor , or the two cars doing 360 after 360 stuck together . give me a break !
positive	as classic a film as ever there was . for a musical it tackled some pretty unusual stuff , from witchcraft , to invading nazis . the whole cast is good and the fun of it all is the convaluted storyline that leads the heroes to a climactic show down with the stormtroopers of nazi germany by way of reanimated suits of armor . some great stuff . best scene : the animated soccer match
negative	very bad .
positive	too cute , too perfect and i still love it . this remake is just as good as the original . steve martin is hilarious and i just love kimberly williams . simple fluffy fun .
positive	definatelly one of frank darabont's greatest work . his adaptation of stephen king's original novel was just fabulous . this movie really speaks to the soul , and people can learn alot from this masterpiece .
positive	this and shrek are the best children's movies since aladdin . they make the whole family laugh .
positive	well , let's just say i was surprised . hanks and zemekis and a great film .
positive	i love when frodo disappeared up the ring !
positive	i love this one and the seconed one to great plot a black batman .
positive	one of my favourite films ever ! everything about it is brilliant , from the acting , directing , casting , to the plot , humour and look / feel of the film . christian bale is perfect as pat bateman and he is genuinely intense and powerful ( physically and mentally ) througout . the fact that i love all things new york and 80s was pretty convenient in this film ! the soundtrack is great , with huey lewis and phil collins fitting in well , contrasting against the violence being portrayed . for example huey being played while bateman axe-murders a colleague . the idea that everyone on wall street at that time is anonymous is clever , such as bateman being mistaken for other people by his own colleagues , and the displacement of identity is a foremost theme here due to commercialism and vanity . easton ellis' book is brilliantly written and extremely graphic ( in both good , e . g . knowledge of the hit records released in the 80s , and bad ways , e . g . killing of the prostitute ) , although the film's locations , settings and direction are needed to complete the look to the story . fantastic !
positive	a simple guy with simple goals but who conquered the world . . . who couldn't like a movie like that whether it's sports or something else ?
positive	it's not easy to think of a better war movie . not only are the attempts to finish the sub off very realistic , but the movie did a terrific job establishing the sub captain as soldiers divorced from their fellow german war criminals .
positive	the best of the rambo series , and the most believable . this is stallones best movie since rocky .
positive	absolutely amazing movie . . the special effects were out of this world . . keanu reeves acted brilliantly and was supported really well by lawrence . the story was spectacular and though it was slightly slow in the starting it was covered up by the end which was really good fun . . it paved a new way for sci-fi movies and special effects
negative	hated it .
negative	hated it .
positive	it's a masterpiece . gibson did a great job . very biblical .
positive	finally , after waiting much longer than i'd intended , i saw fellowship of the ring and was thoroughly impressed . i first read the trilogy many years ago and have read it numerous times since . i doubted that any movie could come even close to the magic and power of the books ; however , peter jackson has succeeded in being very true to tolkien's creation . most of the changes were simply omissions , and surely no one could have expected every part of the book could be included in a 3-hour movie . although not all of the cast lives up to my own vision of the characters , i thought they were excellent and created their own very genuine versions of the characters they played . i agree with several of the points made by jays but definitely disagree with the conclusion he makes in update . i have read and appreciated the trilogy for a very long time but was not annoyed by the movie at all -- in fact , i enjoyed it thoroughly and can hardly wait for the release of the two towers .
negative	the first time i watched it i almost fell asleep .
positive	at first , i too was in the boat of saying hey , this isn't a comedy but what else is it ? it's too funny to be a drama , not scary enough to be a suspense . . . it's the closest fit . categories aside , i loved it . my all-time favorite . what a way for tommy to bust on the scene .
positive	very sad .
positive	kate winslet is profeesional and talented , and movie with her in it is a winner .
positive	very well done . i grew up watching and reading x-men . so i was very satisfied with how this was done . the cast was perfect with one or two exceptions . i was pleased that they decided to keep magneto's origin . since that is his main reason for despising mankind . but like all comic book movies it wasn't exactly like the comic . but considering that fictional characters have been turned into flesh abd blood actors it is easy to forgive these faults . i expect the same satisfaction from the sequel .
positive	i loved this movie ! the mummy and the sequel of it were tottally thrilling . plus , i've always had a big interest in egypt and coffins .
positive	i think this was the best out of the batman films produced . tim burton injected the correct atmosphere and the characters were fantastic . the second followed its example and was outstanding . i think the others make a mockery of the concept of batman , therefore batman and the second one will always be the best original ones .
positive	the scariest movie of all time . everything about it was scary ! ! the posessed girl's face still haunts me . the make-up job was superb .
positive	this is just a great movie , if you look beyond humor .
positive	this movie is excellent . the graphics are improved over the original ( except for the humans , they are still too reflective ) . the story line is interesting for kids and adults , taking lines from many of our favorite classics . while i thought the adult humour was a little much for a child-oriented movie , the barbie dance scene and buzz lightyear's reaction to jesse had me rolling in the aisle with laughter . i highly recommend the film .
positive	i am probally going to get slammed for this , but i like this and the phantom menace alot .
negative	samuel l jackson : an excellent top-notch performer who wows audiences everywhere . too bad he went so low by performing in this flick just used to get teens to come and see the wasted vin diesel . good action scenes come few and far between . . . usually . there are none in this flick .
positive	james stewert in his best role ever as a small town do-gooder become politician . he slowly relizes what type of a place washington dc is and the flaws in our government in this still powerful / important film .
positive	the original blair witch was a cultural phenomina . even if you never saw it you heard about it . i think alot of people chose to dislike the original because everyone else loved it so in turn found it hip to hate it . so , i think many people contiously chose to dislike book of shadows before ever giveing this great film a chance . it was a very brave move for joe berlinger ( director of paradise lost , paradise lost 2 revelations and brother's keeper ) to take the reins and direct a film many people had already chosen to kill with criticism . it was cool of joe to take a different approach to making this film . the veteran documintarian decided to take the documentary styled blair witch project sequel and shoot completly different . i think this was also the smart move . if it had beed done using the same formula and technique it wouldn't have been as fresh or inventive as the original . not only that but so many blair witch project spoofs have come out i'm sure he didn't want any confusion . i also think it was clever to take the characters out of the woods and put them in a loft . the acting as well as the directing in my opinion is flawless . you could not ask for a more complex and thought provoking story . the directing , the acting and the score really bring this film to life . this movie also differs from just about any sequel i have ever seen in that no characters from the original ever show up ( except for the un named evil that could just be a collective dellusion . ) , the movie directly comments on the success of the original film and it questions the existince of the main star of the series . . . the blair witch . the story asks the question are the five teens the latest victims of the evil that exists in the black hills or is it possible the blair witch does not exist at all ? were the five youngins who are all obssesed with the blair witch in their own way driven into a killing spree caused by the mass hysteria created by the media frenzy surrounding the blair witch project ? evil is human not supernatural . that it comes from within . these five kids don't remember what they did . is it history or hysteria ? a very cool film that makes you think and never ever lets me sit through a viewing without getting goosebumps and cold chills . if you haven't seen this film yet do so but with an open mind . if you saw this film and hated it , try sitting through it again using that same open mind techniqe i just mentioned . this film is very smart . smart and creative in all the ways many horror films these days are not . purely in the fact that there is no straight here let me spell it out for you answers in this movie . you might come out confused but it will also leave you thinking . . . and stunned . a genuinly good mystery horror movie . jeff donovan is the man !
positive	one of my all time favorites movies .
positive	this film porves that the academy awards don't mean a thing for night of the hunter wasn't even nominated for a single oscar .
positive	my best friend and i love this movie ! ! ! we've seen this movie a lot and every time we laugh at it really enjoy it ! but i have to admit , i like the sequal better ( ace ventura when nature calls )
positive	i don't much care for paltrow , but even she was good in this . a truly beautiful motion picture . well-written !
positive	an instant classic !

negative	my last review of this film was so offensive that they couldn't post it . this sick testament to racist american values left me feeling so sick and cynical as to nearly provoke violence in my otherwise pacifist spirit . this is the worst film that i have ever seen , after phantasm 2 and countless other sequels , horror schlockfests , and exploitation films . this film insulted my soul . its paen to romance is a farce in itself , with such flat dialogue that i cannot even remember it to quote it . . . the female lead , miss beckinsale , has managed to feign likability eben in the face of her despicably empty foray into quick sex in public , something that i know is viciously empty in itself . but the act is romanticized ! the cinematography and unnecessarily sexy setting alone are ridiculous . when mr . hartnett inevitably lays down his racist , war-mongering life for the good old usa , i was moved to laughter . the constant stream of racial slurs delivered by our heroic boys are evocative of the wonderfully propagandist flicks of the war era itself , and their stupid patriotism is so empty as to insult anyone who has ever laid down their life for any country . this is the perfect antithesis to arlington national cemetary , to saving private ryan , to the young , innocent dead ! i have never felt guiltier for my nationality , not when standing at the smithsonian looking at the tribute to the japanese oppressed by our people in internment camps during ww2 , whose plight was caused by those empty fools who share the morale professed by this sick , sad film , not when reading of the conditions of the slaves whose oppression was enforced by our former presidents . the film left me so ill as to wish the death of the touching conclusion's little boy in vietnam , being brought up in the vein of his dear daddies , doubtless to become one of the crouching , slurring monuments to blind racism , running through the grass with an automatic weapon and a desire for the blood of an unseen foe , and certainly not enjoying the kill 'em all glory that his fathers managed . . . when he is blown apart by an unseen mine , i wonder what mr . affleck's character would do . . . erect a monument to his heroism . sick . this film is a sick , war-loving void , whose romance will doubtless result in the philandering of countless impressionable young girls , and whose racist violence is eerily reminiscent of the modern national sentiment toward the afghanis . . . it's okay to hate , kids ! it's okay to kill . . . okay . . . this is the most insulting , most vapid , most vile film in my realm of experience . blasphemy , cruelty , madness and publicity . a bloated , painted devil-whore .
positive	this was such a sad story . at first it's all fun and games , where the main charcter expects to sell drugs forever . but as they feel an uptick in progress , police are everywhere . eventually , he loses everything , even the hallusination of his daughter .
positive	my favorite thing that he says is frickin idot
positive	this is the best movie i have ever seen . although i am brought close to tears upon mention of christopher reeves , my childhood hero , after his tragic accident and then the car commerical in which he walks gives me hope for the future .
negative	at first it was creepy and kinda scary . then it made a turn for the worse all of a sudden , and didn't get much better from that point on . the ending was just horrible . one of the worst endings i have seen in horror movies in a long time . i am kinda scared to watch the sequel , hope it doesn't suck as bad as this one . bleah .
positive	what more could you want ! ? 50 sweet cars , great action , great actors . ( go cage ! ) this movie is great !
positive	wonderfull
positive	cormac mccarthy's all the pretty horses was one of the first books tackled by my book club . all of us , to a person , were dismayed when finding out that matt damon was going to play john grady cole , thinking him not much more than a 21st century brat pack-er . were we ever wrong . he did an incredible job in what i think is the movie of the year . billie bob thornton's direction was incredible , marty stuart's music was inspiring and all three actors turned in oscar caliber performances . i am one of the few people who thought the love story got just as much attention as it deserved . i would have hated to see this movie turn into another prince of tides . i loved this movie .
positive	i had real reservations about this film . i usually don't enjoy much that drew berrymore and cameron diaz do . i was totally shocked . this movie absolutely rocks . the perfect mix of humor , action , camp , and sex appeal . my wife and i bought it as soon as it came to dvd . we never seem to get tired of watching .
positive	the movies going to be kick-ass i saw the trailer and read about it and it'll be better than the first
negative	sorry , i hated this film . it was very loud , brutal , violent , and way too long . the movie ended after an hour , then ended 45 minutes later , then ran out of steam finally after about three and a half hours . as roger ebert once said , you can tell a movie is bad when you look at your watch . then look at it again . then shake it to see if it's stopped . i would go on about historical inaccuracies . . . . this movie couldn't seem to find a time setting . there were native americans doing martial arts . and the wolf itself , some kind of giant [ badly done ] cgi badger with armor obscuring you from seeing it ( when you finally do see it , they use the standard hiding the monster bit for most of the film ) . if i had to say anything , the photography , settings , and costumes were beautiful . but when the only way you can validate a film is the costumes , you know the plot and chaarcters are lacking . i was completely surprised . i expected a sensible , well-done french film . what i got was a nonsensical american-style blockbuster .
positive	this is a wonderful film . see it . think for youself .
positive	best damn scorcese movie ever hands down .
negative	worst remake ever
positive	this movie made me jump in terror . there were moments when i was so scared i couldn't even look at the screen .
negative	i thought this was the tbn cast doing another telethon .
negative	i hated stars wars , revenge od the sith . i thought is was soooo stupid . i don't see why it was such a big deal to be released . i am so glad that this was the last one & i won't ever have to hear about stars wars after this .
positive	this is such an excellent movie . it made me feel good , and it was so cute . as always , reese witherspoon does a superb job . if you are in a down mood , and want a lift , rent this movie or legally blonde 2 . both are available on dvd ! it is also a cool movie for people who love chihuahua dogs . very few movies show these particular dogs for as smart as they truly are . we love you reese ! no actress could ever top your talent !
positive	i've seen the movie and it's great . i think so at least . it's really funny , and if you ever get the chance , you should check out any kevin smith movie cuz i think they're good and they're funny .
positive	hilarious . one of the best jokes is how many people think badges ? we don't need no stinkin' badges . comes from this movie . for the hoi-polloi , the line is from treasure of the sierra madre .
negative	crappy movie
negative	i hated this movie . the ending sucked and to me it didnt make a whole lot of sense but thats my opinion . my kids liked it .
positive	if you enjoyed this movie , then you ought to read mozart bywolfgang hildesheimer . mozart was a very twisted , perverted genius .
positive	i can't believe that the purile crap served up by american beauty gets in the top 5 here while magnolia scrapes in at around 40 . this film had more humanity in one look than ab had in all the cliched rose bushes in lancashire and yorkshire combined .
positive	deniro's best . why is rocky rated higher than this wonderful movie ?
positive	a barge captain and dreamily romantic young bride travel the seine and parisian waterways , in the company of numerous cats and a memorably eccentric first mate with a hoard of unusual bric-a-brac . a warm , leisurely , lyrical and gently anarchic adventure , infused with a poetic sense of wonderment , jean vigo's only feature film ( before his death at 28 ) has been voted one of the world's top 10 in numerous polls . a precious pearl , to be discovered and cherished .
negative	can't stand gangster-type films
positive	a true classic . . . . the best anti-war movie ever made . it holds up well with realistic scenes of trench warfare and a first rate story line .
positive	one of the most hilarious movies i've ever seen ! poigant and powerful in a way that affects us all . a true beauty .
positive	this is a perfect picture . if ever there was a perfect cast , it is in this film . they make the film come alive . a david o . selnick film which , in my opinion , is his greatest acheivement and alfred hitchcock's american directorial debut is an auspicious one ! joan fontaine deserved best actress oscar for her performance as the second mrs . dewinter as did judith anderson for best supporting actress for her mrs . danvers .
positive	hilarious !
positive	hilarious !
positive	hilarious !
positive	one of my favorite bill murray movies , it's very funny and should be higher on the list .
positive	fantastic scenery and vocals for the time . a beautiful movie . back in the day when clean ( you know boring ) and happy endings ( no heads flying off with viens dangling out . . . ) were in . kinda miss those days sometime .
positive	my favorite movie of all times ! ! i loved the cast of this movie . jennifer love hewitt's tremendous performance propelled her to stardom . this movie was very scary and hip .
positive	like an old fashioned horror
positive	the greatest movie of all time ! vivien leigh is great as scarlett o'hara and she deserved every award for it . mammy was very funny and provided a good dramatic foil for scarlett . there is certainly great chemistry between scarlett rhett ( clark gable ) and will probably be remembered for all time and provide an example of what actors should do .
positive	fantastic movie .
positive	fantastic movie .
negative	this is one of the worst movies ever made . i did not laugh once . the jokes were very cliche and dull . almost like the jokes i used to hear in elementary school . really , is a man getting his butt crack waxed funny ? the humor is rediculousely dumb to the point of making the viewer feel sorry for everyone involved . word of advice if you like good comedies don't see anything by the production team who brought you big daddy or deuce bigalow . if you are a numb skull go check it out .
negative	michael moore can kiss my republican ass .
positive	what a great movie . i didn't see shawshank redemption in the theater , and nobody ever recommended it to me . so when i rented it one night i had low expectations , and it surprised me quite a bit when the movie easily jumped into my all-time top 10 list . the story and the acting are both excellent . but i think the thing that pushes this movie to the next level is the way it inspires you without being sappy , without resorting to the typical ham-handed techniques movies use to play on your emotions . shawshank isn't fancy - it just tells a powerful story in a way that makes you really care about the characters . and laced into that is this great message about freedom and the power of hope . see - it's hard to even write power of hope without cringing , so imagine how tough it must be to make a great movie about it without crossing the line into sap . well , regardless of how it accomplishes that feat , this movie is a must-see .
negative	it had canadian actors and script , which no one likes . the plot was terrible , yet predictable .
positive	i agree with niterider ( sorta ) , it really is a good movie , it's my favorite movie , very romantic and great acting . it should be at # 1 .
negative	wonderful heart warming family film . you'll laugh , you'll cry . you'll want you'r f * cking money back ! ! what a stinky piece ! ! ! ! !
positive	robert preston and julie andrews are fantastic . from their singing to their acting it was very well done . the supporting cast did very well in most cases . a wonderful story . very different from what is offered most of the time currently . an all-around fun movie that has many humorous moments . even the former football player is good .
positive	great movie . . . the best actress is in it and she did a fantastic job ! awesome singer and dancer !
negative	awful . a script so full of cliches it could have been written by a grade seven student . it might have been better if it had been .
positive	what to say about it it's just excellent
negative	found the movie very very crude and demeaning to women . good message at the end but u have to waste an hour and half to get to it . i'm very open-minded , don't offend easily as are my friends . . . . but i dont know anyone who liked it . it was just a really bad movie . . poor taste and a major waste of 10 bucks ! ! ! ! american pie was much much better ! ! ! don't waste ur money ! ! ! !
positive	i think this is one of the bravest films to be released in a long time . done quite lovingly , the artistry is fantastic and the acting shines even though done in latin and aramiac . however to say this film is not for everyone would be a huge understatement . the graphic violence and gore is truly shocking but i certainly don't think it was gratuitous . mel gibson set out to make passion accurately and not gloss over christ's suffering . the accusations of anti-semitism is ridiculous-anyone who has researched that time period knows who ordered christ to die . i applaud gibson for not straying from his vision to please certain groups of people . i myself am not a religious person and i was moved intensely by this film . you feel every aspect of christ's agony along with him . it is a film i will remember for the rest of my life and i highly recommend it but only for those with an iron-clad stomach .
positive	fantastic
positive	fantastic
positive	9 to 5 is definatly one of the funniest movies ever made , and may be called classic one day . it never stops delivering laughs and it's fast-paced and exciting . judy , violet , and dorlee are 3 secretaries to a sexiest , egotistical , lying , hypocritical bigot boss , mr . hart . 9 to 5 was the perfect movie , and colin higgins , the director recieves full credit .
negative	you may not find this review helpful , but all i can say is this film was the biggest insult to a film lover ever . it shouldn't have been , since it was the most contrived slasher movie i have ever seen , but still , its stupidity makes you feel good about yourself , and bad about hollywood , and the human race .
positive	this is a fun movie throughout that i can watch over and over . too bad the sequels were all so horrible .
positive	cate blanchett was superb as elizabeth , she deserved the oscar . a brilliant portrayl of the virgin queen . i believe that it matters very little that there may be small historical innacuracies in the movie , for 'elizabeth' inspires the watcher the learn more about elizabeth i for themselves .
positive	funny and moving . the only problem i saw was that there were far too many climactic moments in which they played the overly dramatic music and some important decision is made , etc . most movies lead up to one of these , however i think remember the titans had about six . that didn't annoy me enough to inspire me to subtract a star , however . denzel washington was excellent , i thought . plus , a good soundtrack !
positive	i've never seen this movie , but i want to , because i like movies that have the brat pack , and i love rob lowe . a lot of people have said that it was good .
positive	this film is what an imax movie was meant to be . fantastic use of the format--astonishing visual treats .
positive	a lovely heart-warming story .
positive	beautiful film . it hurt so much that it was so good . i can't ever watch it again , but i thought it was amazing !
negative	it won an oscar . it had the funny jim carrey and the beautiful kate winslet . but i frankly found it one of the most boring , stultifying , and wearisome movies i have seen in a long time . right up there with the death-inducing dogville in terms of boredom . we watched it one night , wifey passed out in 10 minutes and i made it to 15 . she blamed me that looking at my droopy eyes made her fall asleep . we tried again a couple of nights later . she konked out in 8 minutes this time while i pretty much drifted off to sleep about the same juncture as the previous night . she had the chutzpah to say the next morning , i still want to see it . now how good of a movie could it be if it puts 2 fairly intelligent adults asleep twice ? my theory is that i just can't stand charlie kauffman movies , as i found being john malkovich almost as boring and stupid . kauffman looked like such a dork at the oscars during his acceptance speech . 30 seconds , 29 seconds , i find this very unsettling , 26 seconds , i can't think of any thing to say , this is so distracting , 24 seconds . . .
positive	the ultimate date movie . this little-known laugh riot only lasted in theatres maybe one week before going straight to video and cable . love stinks makes fatal attraction look like a ride at disneyland . the humor is raunchy at times--but every zinger is so intelligently written that you can't help but get absorbed by the chemistry shared between the beautiful , but oh-so possessive bridgette wilson and the nice guy pushed too far antics of french stewart ( from t . v . 's 3rd rock ) of course , the true lovers of this flick will be the ones that have first-hand experience of bitter break-ups .
positive	i saw the left behind movie and i thought it was very well done ! i read all the books and i think the movie having not been edited by hollywood standards stayed very much along the story in the left behind book . i can understand why some might be threatened by the truth of the movie and i am sure that when jerry jenkins and tim lahaye went ahead with the movie idea they were fully aware that some would react in a critical way . i once heard a man of god say that the cross is offensive in it's content , because it calls a person to be aware of thier own accountability . so it makes sense that anything referring to christ and the cross will offend those that reject it . having the truth of christ given in this movie brings up the fear that unbelievers experience just like i did the first time i read the book of revelation as a non-believer . i think the acting was very refreshing .
negative	a very bad score .
positive	i love this movie ! it is soo wonderful . it is my 2nd . fav in the george a romero zombie movies ! i have seen this movie 56 times before !
positive	powerful and rich portrait of t . e . lawrence , and one of the deepest character portraits in cinema . i love the way you see him coming unglued during some of the violent scenes . superb music score .
positive	i thought that it was quite funny . it kept my little brother laughing the whole time . it is not the best for adults but if your looking for something to keep alittle kid out of your hair for a while it is aweaome . the best part of the movie was the blooperes . those were seriously funny . most sequels are bad but this is almost as good as the second one . i recommend it .
positive	my husband and i own this movie and we , along with my in-laws , absolutely love it . it is by far one of our favorites . i recommend it to anyone who likes horror movies .
positive	it's pretty much impossible to not like any of these movies . people complain about how long it is , but i think that just makes it better .
negative	if i could i would get all the austin powers 2 vhs and dvd videos over at my house , take them out back and take a fat dump on all of them .
positive	excellent storyline and idea that turned into another classic . ive never read the book , so i am not comparing the two together . this movie definetely has some really good scenes . the scene with the blood in the hallway freaks me out every time i see it !
negative	with a great cast who would have thought this movie could be soooo bad !
positive	one of the best movies of all time . the horror just builds and builds . a great story that was particularly well acted .
negative	this movie sucks . worst bond movie ever made , well it beats casino royale , but even avtak and nsna are better than dad .
positive	the only classic movie that makes one laugh out loud after repeated viewings ! ! well deserves all the praise it has received .
positive	a truly suspensful movie . . . the first scene is great
positive	entertaining all the way through . never a dull moment and full over every emotion . qt knows how to cast the right person to get the best out of them and make a kick * ss ride out a movie .
negative	forrest gump is , without a shadow of a doubt , the worst film i have ever had the sad misfortune of viewing . this celebration of gross stupidity is crass , completely lacking in any genuine wit and moves at a sloth-like pace from ridiculously contrived plotline to another . tom hanks , a leviathan of modern film-making , is as sickly and lacking in charisma as ever . i would sooner watch my grandmother being savaged by rabid tigers than view this piece of rubbish again .
positive	this was the best movie i have seen in a long time ! it's action packed and full of surprises ! ! once you see it , you'll be hooked , for sure ! ! ! here's hoping there will be a sequel ! ! ^ _ ^
positive	magical fantasy , hilarious with a wonderful cast of characters .
negative	is it all julia stiles can do is films with interracial relationships ? ? ? not being racist at all , but enough already , we get the point ! ! ! !
negative	that movie was an asault on my ears !
negative	lame ! just another boring canister in which to shove a whole bunch of special effects . the original one was infinately better .
negative	people , this movie sucked and still does . nothing will compare to the equally bad original . this one is the exact same tale from the original , only in new york . uninspired and lame .
positive	wow . as soon as the movie was at its resolution , i knew it was a good movie . the end , however , left me stunned and speechless . the people who made this movie couldn't have done any better . the little boy ( what was his name ? ) should definetly appear in more movies . i believe he is very talented ( even more talented than some of the actors today ) . bruce willis's acting speaks for itself . he's wonderful , as always !
positive	a really awesome movie . the storyline was very spiritual , it made people think even though they didn't know they were thinking .
positive	take into consideration the fact that they had a group of people who were largely inexperienced , very little money , and no history of this kind of movie to help carry it , it's that much more impressive how good and funny this movie is . everything from porkys to fast times at ridgemont high to american pie can draw a line from their success to animal house . is the success of animal house over ? was it over when the germans bombed pearl harbor ?
negative	i hated this british drama . it only glorified drug use and stupidity . the movie is highly overrated and a waste of time to watch .
negative	didn't get through the first 20 m's of it . boring !
positive	omg omg , so funny !
positive	hilarious . nicholson does an outstanding job playing an obsessive compulsive writer struggling to interact with other people . supporting cast also rocks .
positive	one of the most twisted , funny movies out there , this film shows off the talent of director spike jonze in so many ways . the first scene grabs you and you question how silly this movie is . just when you think it can't get anymore outrageous , the next scene blows you out of your seat with squeals of delight .
positive	one of the best thrillers of the last 15 years .
positive	bruce greenwood didn't really play kennedy very well in the movie , but the screenplay of the movie was excellent nonetheless . it moves very quickly without getting mired in detail , which is a tendency in movies that recreate actual events . it hit all of the strategic concerns revolving around the missile crisis . really this event was the turning point in the cold war . policymakers came to grips with the fact that nuclear annihilation was a very real possibility with escalating conflict . thirteen days very accurately portrayed the myriad of potential solutions to the deadlock like war with the soviets or a blockade . the joint chiefs wanted war while the civilian leadership was more cautious . if you want a peek at how official washington operates , take a look at this movie . the movie portrays the high point of the kennedy administration , one that has a decidedly mixed record ( sorry redoedo ) . he got off to a very slow start but i would say that this was his baptismal by fire . he played hardball with the soviets after this . the cuban missile crisis also really changed the whole dynamic of the cold war . the realities of nuclear annihilation became a very real , tangible possibility . the us and the soviets had to improve relations or else there would have been a nuclear exchange ; something that wouldn't have benefitted anyone at the end of the day . so anyways , minus greenwood's bad portrayal of kennedy , i would say it's a great movie .
positive	one of the most unforgettable and moving films of the last 3 decades . this performance by meryl streep is an unequalled masterpiece . also great performances by kevin kline and peter macnichol . the story is heartbreaking and poignant . magnificent !
positive	good movie . i enjoyed it . suprisingly
positive	i think this movie is really funny , good work !
positive	i loved it ! ! ! i want to be a coyoty ugly for life ! ! ! the music was awesome and i used to be a dancer so i couldn't sit still . i love the music and i love how it made women feel like they rule ! ! !
positive	i saw this movie three days ofter the release on may 19 , 1999 , it blew me away . i went home after and the next day i couldn't help but tell everyone how great this movie was . all of the acting by liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , natalie portman , and rey park gave you a good sense on how the surroundings should interact with the actors . desert scenes with old faces , ( liam neeson ) . that's how a movie should work . the fight scenes with darth maul and his dual-bladed lightsaber versus qui-gon and obi-wan , prompted me to go again . the music was excellent , it gave you a good feeling for the action . the best of the 4 star wars movies .
positive	edward scissorhands . . . . . haha . awesome !
positive	every girl i know who is my age , watched this movie religiously at sleepovers . it's the best childhood nastoliga i know of . it's cornball plot , ending with the dance where baby struts her stuff was so cool then , and notorious now . it's fun and you can sing along with all the songs .
positive	my all time favorite .
positive	best movie ever ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if you dont see this movie you suck !
positive	stupendous classic the moment it hits the screen . gorgeous to look at , wonderfully wrought with such loving care and reverence for the literary legend .
negative	grow up !
positive	this movie was great--a perfect balance between gory violence and healthy patriotism . restraint was an interesting idea for a theme . and i'm glad mel didn't have any . most importantly , though , was how this movie was neither a fraud nor a sham . a definite plus .
positive	i absolutely love everything about this movie ! i can't wait to see the second one .
positive	flawless entertainment . john travolta shows his immense complexity as an alien . his performance is so convincing he may actually be one . forest whitaker i know is an alien because he starred in ghost dog . i recommend this film to everyone ( who also likes to stick forks up their butts . )
positive	probably considered a guy movie , but a classic all the same . makes you want to go out and buy naked lady tees after watching it .
positive	very funny , well scripted and very strong performances all around .
positive	i think save the last dance was a very good movie ! ! it had all the sweet romantic things a long with the fighting sences all the guys like ! ! if i had to , i would watch that movie every day ! !
positive	superb ! i went to see it when i was six and i just loved it ! my all time fave for animation !
negative	it's almost embarrasing how bad this horror movie was , because it was liked by teenagers and the critics . jennifer love hewitt was totally silly and unstable in her role , and the rest of the cast was too tired and craweled throughout the whole film .
positive	if you're human , this movie will move your heart and make you think . the combination of excellent acting and a realistic script will lead you to consider what happens to those who personally pay the price of freeedom .
negative	how did this movie garner so much critical acclaim ? furthermore , how could this movie be so bad when it had so many fine actors ? the plot moved way too slowly for my taste . i found myself not caring about any of the characters , ( they weren't very likable ) which caused me not to care about what happened in the movie . one of the worst films i've ever seen .
negative	god-awful maudlin junk . the ship should have sunk an hour earlier and saved us all the angst .
negative	this movie sucked . i laughed ( at the stupid acting , storyline , casting , and action scenes . ) , i cried ( because the damn movie just would never end . ) i fell asleep ( for obvious and aformentioned reasons . ) i saw this movie on prom night with all of my friends and maybe because we were all too busy making fun of it i really missed the whole point . . but i doubt it .
positive	one of my all-time favorites ! how can this not be at the top of this list ?
positive	fargo is the funniest murder movie ever . i saw it in the theaters three times and then bought it right when it came out . is that your partner in the woodchipper there ? frances mcdormand was hilarious .
positive	when i first heard about pearl harbor , i saw it was around my birthday , so i decided to check it out . i went on the internet and all these critics were trashing it . i couldn't believe it , then i went to see the movie , and it was better than ever ! almost better than star wars ! everyone in the movie did an excellent job . this movie is for all to see .
positive	very unique storyline , and the special effects with the aliens were spectacular . the ideas set forth in the movie were very creative .
positive	greatest childrens movie ever and i need just one word . scrat ! ( and its not that bad to watch if you are an adult as well . just ask me )
positive	fantastic computer graphics and storyline . tom hanks always seems to be at his best when it comes to children films . the actors voices are brilliant and the characters lovable . i love this film so much that my partner bought me ts1 2 on dvd for christmas !
positive	this is real comedy . . .
positive	this is a great movie . it shows the hardship that oklahomans went thru during the depression and the dust bowl .
positive	'the godfather' is simply one of the greatest ( if not the greatest ever ) . this movie has it all , and anyone who has ever sat down to watch it is immediately pulled into the world of the corleones for the entire length of the movie . with the mixture of storyline and casting , along with the light and dark , this movie captures the very essence of what filmmaking is all about and more . 'the godfather' is art at its finest- magnificent ! ! !
positive	one of the funnest , and best shows of the year .
positive	as times goes on , this movie gets lost in the discussions of great movies from the past 10-15 years , but it shouldn't . it takes an old theme ( time travel ) and makes it a part of an original story . i only wish they had stopped at this one and not done the two sequals .
negative	ashton kutcher . that explains everything . i still like the and then thing but he can take no credit for that .
positive	freakin great film , never got bored during film at all , i only wished for more and more . halli was excelent with her charactor , all of the charactors had an effect on you , either you liked them or you hated them ( not hating them becuase you think them movie sucked , you hated them beucase you like the evil of that character . overall this movie needs a second one because i walked out of the theaters cat crazy and ready to to climb on walls .
negative	from justin to kelly to the toilet . the producers should be shot .
positive	a 3 hour long pacino saga that never gets old .
negative	you people are so thirsty for a good horror film you seem to settle for cheap hour and a half long x-file knock off garbage . i saw this film the night it was realesed with high hopes of a great exorcist like film . i wanted to be jolted i wanted to be frightened and i wanted the film to give me something to think about . instead i got another high budget attempt at money making . this film is prpackaged cotton candy crap ! i think my i . q . dropped 10 points just from witnessing such an attrocity . i was ashamed . i am all for religion in cinema . i myself am not a religious man at all even though i was raised in a christian house hold . i can see how some people got a message from stigmata and i can see how it opens some peoples eyes to a new world but those people must realize this new world they are seeing is based in a lame fictitious horror movie world that is based in no solid evidence and is made to make the schmuks who believe the tabloids paranoid . sad stuff , man . . .
negative	don't waste your time . . . this is a really bad movie .
positive	great leading role . poignant social issues even today .
positive	not just a great horror movie but a great movie . anyone should enjoy this whether they're into the genre or not . it has timeless suspense , warmth and humor . alone . . . bad . . . friend . . . good !
positive	one of my favorites
positive	save the last dance was one of the best movies i've ever seen because not only did it have terrific dancing , but it dealt with real issues in the world , such as rasicm
positive	one of the best modern gangster films of all time . joe pesci in one of his best roles , with his classic scene funny how ! the rise and fall of big-time , small time criminals with no family backing them . plus , the youthful shots of ray liota's character in the beginning of the film are a nice touch .
positive	an excellent thriller with an outstanding cast . the effects are awsome a good candidate for imax redo .
positive	this was a great movie . there were really cool visual effects and an edge of your seat storyline to keep you interested . both john and nicholas did an excellent acting job as well as keeping the storyline . see it !
positive	i love demi , think jack is terrific , even tom was good . . .
negative	this film is so bad that i have to turn off the tv within the first 5 minutes .
positive	good film that illustrates morality and faith . should be seen by any christian who likes foreign cinema .
positive	funny ! ! !
positive	this was one of my favorite movies . i'm not all that into war , but this movie really helped me out a lot . it showed me that afro-americans really made a difference in the world , even though it took us a long time . i would love to have been back then , only to fight and prove a point to myself and others .
positive	after i saw this movie , i started driving by convenience stores that were not on the way home
positive	didn't understand it but it made me laugh !
positive	top rate - you like dags ?
negative	well , it was a good start to the new brangelina movement . they got to make out in a movie , and not feel extremely guilty about it . it was all scripted . . . or so we think .
negative	bad movie .
negative	just shoot this horse already . i laughed . i cried . i almost lost control of my faculties . this film is the height , the epitome of chick-flickism . the trials , the tribulations : whoa is me . if you're forced to watch it , bring some arsnic .
positive	good , great , best !
positive	masterpiece . gotta see it .
positive	a flawless piece .
negative	this movie isn't worth watching if someone gave you the dvd free . . assuming it is on dvd already . . . do not waste your money on this . . . it is just another idiotic chris farley nightmare . . .
positive	excellent film noir , one of the best ever made . great script and terrific performances by joseph cotten , vali , trevor howard and especially orson welles . the cinematography gives the right mood , and no way could this movie have been made years later in color . the zither music is unique , unfortgettable but fitting .
positive	easily one of the best movies ive seen in a long time , just second to amores perros . eternal sunshine is one of the great love stories of our time told with great pace , inteligence and always avoiding corny spots ( very non - hollywood ) . very few movies have been this keen and this smart at trying to find the essence of love and of relationships in general between men and women . i used to hate charlie kaufman and dismiss him as an eccentric screenwriter in urgent need of a valium or a mental institution , with this he reedems himself completely . bravo ! matas pontdebulle
positive	a fine film recording the life and sad ending to a life of enormous creativity . monk is one of the world's great artists and composers .
positive	i dont know about anybody else , but if you see this movie in the theatres , it will haunt you . this movie does a good job to get into your mind . the images were very eerie and hard to forget , the ghost was simply creepy . also have some good scenes that make you jump . very unpredictable , especially the ending , one of the most serious endings i've ever witnessed !
negative	a movie that has no respect for the middle class . the scene in which mena suvari could have been shot in from the side and suggested nudity , but director mendes has no respect for suvari and exposes her . you can see her discomfort . truly and ugly and hateful film .
positive	my fave . it is beautiful , interesting and makes ya think . i wanna buy this oscar winning classic .
positive	when i first saw this movie , i was 12 years old . i remember that the same weekend that i saw it , my room was getting painted , and i had to sleep downstairs in the living room on an air mattress . all night long , i drifted in and out of sleep thinking that i was floating on an inflatable raft in the middle of the ocean with a 25 foot long great white circling me . not my best night's sleep ever , but an excellent , classic movie .
positive	classic performances by chevy chase , bill murray , and rodney dangerfield . you owe it to yourself to see this movie . it is so funny .
negative	what was travolta thinking ? barbarino in space . i kept falling asleep the first time so i thought i'd better watch it again . it was just as bad the second time . some of the fx were cool but not good enough . i remember panning for gold when i was a kid and getting those big gold bars , not ! did terl give them the smelting equipment ? no . i can't beleave anyone set out to make a film this bad . makes me wonder what was left on the cutting room floor . it's to bad that rate it ! wont let me give it zero stars .
negative	warning to my loyal fans : this is an art movie , not a sado-slasher movie . don't even bother clicking the helpful button , guys . i still have 158 horror movies to review !
positive	this is a great movie ! mel brooks is a genious it is one of the best movies of all time .
positive	excellent movie . it was suspenseful and very interesting . i could definitely see it more than once .
positive	top gun was an all time action movie .
positive	this movie appeals to all ages . when i was in college , my group of guy friends always watched the lion king . it was always on when i went over there . it is a great story .
positive	that was a really great movie ! i thought it might be another one of those movies that didn't live up to the book it was based on , but it was a great movie in relation to the book ! important details were left out but the movie itself was great ! i loved it and can't wait for the next one !
positive	if you ever see one movie ( which i hope never happens to you ) see bjm . it has to be the smartest and funniest movie ever . and the only movie to ever use all the letters from a-o in its title .
positive	i love this movie !
positive	i love this movie !
positive	scream was a scary and funny movie the opening puts you in the mood for the rest of the movie
positive	this movie rocked and raised the bar for action and special effects . not only that , but it was actually better than the first one . linda hamilton was a bad ass , and it is nice to see her character evolve to an independant woman from a damsel in distress . good twist on ahhhhhnold character . also , show's that a bad guy ( robert patrick ) doesn't have to be 6 feet tall and muscle bound to be strong , effective and intimidating .
positive	this movie was great because it gives a better , clearer view of what happened to the jews during the holocaust . it is informative and educational and a really great movie to watch for pleasure .
negative	wow , what an awful movie . i mean really , really miserable . as shallow as this sounds , i rented from dusk till dawn because the ads featured salma hayek dancing around scantily clad , and it turns out that was the only part of this movie worth watching . the plot is idiotic , the acting is worse than what you'd expect from bad tv , it's not at all scary , and the attempts at humor fall completely flat . if this movie was any worse , i could almost recommend it as something to laugh at , but it's not even bad enough to be good .
positive	freakin funny and hilarious i love this movie its one of my favorites !
positive	one of my all-time favorites . . . cagney was the best , by his own admission he was simply a song dance man . . . this movie was actually the george m . cohen story and cagney was born for the part . there are some great songs , great dancing ( nobody made it look easier than jimmy with his rubbery legs ) and a nicely told story of a true american hero .
positive	an amazing film . . . a great socio-economic film , sports is merely a backdrop to larger issues . . .
positive	i love this movie and the costumes are great ! ! ! i could'nt believe rhett left her , but it was great when they got back together in scarlett .
positive	subtle acting of morgan freeman and jessica tandy with excellent supporting performances of lupone and aykroyd . very worthwhile-and entertaining
positive	i think fat bastard inpregnated me . ( ha ha sikes ) the movie is so funny . i was rollin .
negative	i haven't seen this but i was told that the message you get at the end is the joke is on you for paying to see this movie ! good one tom . . . . i guess .
positive	gladiator is one of the best movies i've seen when it comes to the time when gladiators , and the romen empire was said to be . it moves pretty fast so you dont get bored like some of the other moves . the plot is neat to crowe starts out as general becomes a slave then becomes a gladiator and upsets the empire . you have to love it .
positive	love this movie !
positive	love this movie !
positive	this is one of the best movies i have ever seen .
negative	despite the film's complimentary reviews and it's growing legion of fans , it is terrible . a special effects extravaganza and not much more . a somewhat confusing plot , and long periods of unexciting storyline don't help this movie live up to it's comic book beginnings . maybe it can all be summed up in two words : keanu reeves .
positive	oh yeah good movie
positive	as a 29 year-old ( straight ) male who owns his share of punk rock cds , i'm thoroughly embarrassed by my love for this movie . every once in a while i'll get its songs stuck in my head . especially that yodelling one that they use during the puppet show . but there's really not a weak spot to the whole movie ( except that one song that maria sings when she's on her way from the convent to the von trapps ) .
negative	my word to describe this movie : unnecessary . between what is truly entertaining and what is a pure waste of time , there is a line . kinsey crossed it . definitely a waste of time . i was interested at first because of the sweet honest romance kinsey and his wife shared and their naivity about sex . it was cute . but the remainder of the movie took a beautiful thing and shat ( is that a word ? ) all over it . my image of lliam neeson is forever ruined .
negative	this is possibly the worst movie ever made and i am ashamed to say that i saw the whole thing . i feel slightly less intelligent after it was finished . wow .
positive	excellent movie with brillant and entertaing comedy . awesome soundtrack and i just love the aussie accents . great cast and an aborably realistic and touching storyline . tre bien !
positive	they can't do that to our pleges - only we can do that to our pleges ! so un-pc and funny it wouldn't get filmed today .
positive	i still watch it every now and then - feels a little like clockwork orange for some reason . . .
positive	released in 1974 , monty python and the holy grail is the first film from the famed british comedy troupe . this movie is not for everyone as the british humor is a specific taste , the movie is very low production , and the screenplay is irreverent and full of odd animation . the story has our group of comedians graham chapman , john cleese , terry gilliam , eric idle , terry jones , and michael palin playing king arthur and his knights as they tackle life during the middle ages and search for the holy grail . the film is full of classic lines and non-sequiturs as it rapidly fluctuates back and forth from the mundane ( eg bantering political theory with peasants and deciding on how to spot a witch ) to the grandiose ( eg a trojan rabbit and a magically guarded bridge ) . much like the arthurian legends themselves , the movie is much like a collection of related short stories as the various knights go on their separate quests and then reunite for the final challenge and an abrupt conclusion . the bottom line is that monty python and the holy grail has become a cult classic and right of passage that must be seen at least once .
positive	really great acting and a wonderful story to it plus it will surely give you a ton of laughs ! ! how can you go wrong with jim carrey ? ? ? you can not !
positive	when i went to see spiderman it had only been released a couple of days . it was very crowded and it seemed to me that the theater was filled with two very different groups of people . half the crowd had never read a spiderman comic book , and knew absolutely nothing about the characters . the other half knew way too much about spidey to be healthy . before the movie started i said to my wife that one half of the audience or the other would have to be disappointed . if it were deep enough to impress the experts it would be way over the heads of the novices . i could not have been more wrong . the whole audience was entertained and everyone enjoyed it . the movie is about 90 % true to the comic book . i remember seeing this movie advertised in theaters before the september attacks . in those early promos they showed an amazing scene where spiderman spun a web between the twin towers and caught a helicopter . after the attacks , the movie's release was held up and all scenes of the towers were removed . some day , in the future , when the wounds heal , i would like to see the original version and compare it to what was released .
positive	i saw boys don't cry on campus and i really liked the movie . the topic was fresh and the acting was very convincing . i thought that it did not try to sugarcoat what is obviously a very emotional topic , and this made boys don't cry , stick in my mind as a powerful movie .
positive	one of my favorite python films ! the ending is especially hillarious .
positive	stab my foot with that pitchfork . . . ow , that didn't hurt . . . haha
positive	four young boys out on an adventure before they're to old to be ruined by adulthood . the relationship between these boys , their interactions and behaviors are all believable . the boys parts are acted very well-river phoenix was great , so were the other 3 who i can't remember their names right now . i've probably seen this movie 5 times , it's on my top 20 .
positive	lucky enough to see it the night before it opened . i loved it . it is amazing how some of the things in the movie looked exactly as i imagined them to . diagon alley for example was almost a perfect match , as was gringott's . hogwarts itself was very different from what i imagined , but it was very cool . i loved the moving staircases ! the actors all perfectly conveyed their characters , and i especially liked daniel radcliffe , emma watson and rupert grint as harry , hermione and ron . robbie coltrane as hagrid was wonderful and they could not have picked a better dumbledore or snape ! i do have only one concern though . the book was about 150 pages , the movie was about 2 . 5 hours . . . what happens when we get to goblet of fire at 750 pages ? in all , i highly recommend this movie !
negative	easily one of the worst movies of all time . crude humor , bad language and tons of disrespect all around . tom green should be arrested .
positive	heath ledger is sooo hot ! the movie was really good and the whole theater got into it .
positive	i peed myself . . .
positive	i'm a big eddie murphy fan , so i think bhc is the best movie of all time .
positive	best movie ever made ! !
positive	do i even need to say anything ?
negative	this was just another dumb blow it up movie . willis is a better actor than this and would have to wait many years to show it .
positive	forrest gump is an incredible mixture of genres . definitely a great movie to see
positive	hitchcock's masterpiece of suspense
positive	this is my favorite movie . its pure fun . perhaps the criticism is true . the plot isnt revolutionary . the characters arent deep . the special effects are not the best . you have to look past all those stuck-up snubs and see the real beauty in this film . the pace is really what grabs you . there is little time spent on characterization , but whats there is done well . the movies overall frenetic pace can be seen as a method of glossing over a lack of characterization , but the main characters backgrounds are revealed quickly , allowing the pace to continue . bruce's character , korbin dallas , is easily established in his opening scene as he takes a phone call : his background in the military , his recent divorce , and his current occupation as a cab driver . the soundtrack lends itself to this pace with its high-energy mix of techno , classical , and middle-eastern sounds . the sound effects themselves are huge and compliment every word and action so well . if you really want to get technical , i think the set design is awesome . it makes the future look grungy and bright all at the same time . the sets often use a large amount of hot colors and pop spots of bright blue against them . the costumes are also bright and incredibly imaginative . additionally , the film utilizes lots of montages and cross-cuts . its hard to explain unless you know the terminology . basically , the editing is genious . it jumps between characters so they tell each others stories . what really made me fall in love with the movie is the humor . a large proportion of the movie is just plain funny , especially with bruces dry , sarcastic humor . not to mention awesome one-liners like , listen lady , i only speak two languages - english and bad english the nearly cartoonish acting by many , notably ian holm and gary oldman , are also hilarious but well done . personally , i find garys the best of all . his over-the-top southern accents adds humor to his monologues . the way all the characters interact is so believable that by the end scene , when bruce tells you not to breath youll find it hard not to do what he says . i do every time . if anything i dare you not to laugh at the robber at korbin dallas door .
positive	the best fightng special effets i've ever seen , and for a sci-fi movie the acting wasn't bad
positive	jim carrey does it again ! hysterical , witty and it does not get boring ! one of my favorites !
negative	needs tom bombadil ! ! ! !
positive	excellent movie . jim carey returns to his old self . this movie is comparable to dumb and dumber . instead of over relying on jim's physical comedy aspect , ( ace ventura 2 , cable guy ) an interesting plot was incorporated as well .
positive	my favorite horror film of all time . this one is not nearly as gory as you would think . there is so much suspense and build-up and it does pay off at the end . you will be scared . that dang creepy music will get to you too .
positive	by the way , this refers to the 1939 version of victor hugo's landmark novel . charles laughton's make-up and acting are a knockout . alfred newman's score is one of the best of the 30s . great visuals and storytelling .
positive	cruise and crowe could become the stewart / capra of their generation .
positive	taxi driver is a great movie that portrays loneliness .
positive	saving private ryan was a great movie . the effects and realism were wonderful . i recommend everyone buy the movie and watch it in surround sound .
negative	i'm in the minority i know , but this movie was not what i expected . it was pure cheese .
positive	5 stars . . . but only ( and i do mean 'only' ) because of the scene where both martin and smith are in the electronics store !
positive	i liked this movie ! different type of movie , very enegetic ! i love brad pitt's charicter , very funny . the ending is great !
positive	the best freakin movie ever made ! ! !
positive	this movie was great ! ! i can't think of anything bad to say about this movie . the cast was great , the acting was great . i just love ben stiller and edward norton . jenna elfman is just breath-taking ! ! !
positive	classic . for some reason ( 'can't put my finger on it ) , f . murray abraham as salieri was phenominal .
positive	no one does it better than speilberg ( plus i just felt like raising the rating . )
positive	great plot and good special effects . the acting was very dramatic and a good script . the ending was the best part of the movie . very creative .
positive	i love this movie , it's great . my all time favorite movie next to gone with the wind . whoever gave this movie a rating of one star must have had a sad , neglected childhood and i feel sorry for them .
positive	the most underrated disney masterpiece ever . it's very exciting and funny . plus the animation is stupendous !
positive	this is the way food is supposed to be done . like water for chocolate could learn something here .
positive	all the right elements are in the mix : the pace is fast without being confusing , the humor dry and witty , the action exciting and suspenceful . if anything is missing its the over-blown ( and obvious ) computer graphics and clichs of a doomed futuristic world that have become the standard for sci-fi ( or any other summer blockbuster , for that matter ) . rather , this is an actual story of people with complicated pasts and uncertain futures ; it just happens to be set in outer space . this movie should become the touchstone for all movies , but especially sci-fi , wherein the focus is on how each particular person -- in keeping with his character -- reacts to the action and environment .
negative	if i hear cera scream one more time ! ! ! !
positive	one of the best movies i have seen in a long time . i frequently go to the movies and find action and suspense to be entertaining but often mixed with violence . this movie is great for all ages . it made me laugh throughout the whole movie . i highly recommend this movie ( and have to many of my friends ) .
negative	i hated this movie ! the music made me physically sick .
positive	no , what say the title or name . well , this movie is as : lat us make the things better , with a smile , with a resultq : human being respectfullity for us mother earth . let us life : that's so beautiful or not ? franscis
positive	the greatest ! ! star wars is silly kid stuff compared to this classic .
positive	one of my favorite movies of all time . superb scenery but a little violent . i loved it
negative	this movie sucks ! there was no actual plot , and all the characters seemed fake , and the acting was horrible . this movie was the worst of all three . the whole movie was so bad it was painful to watch .
positive	the blackest of all black comedies . kubrick is brilliant
negative	if you try to make a movie out of a bad show , then what are you trying to accomplish ? ? ? nothing . and you get nothing out of this high-budget film that doesn't get anywhere .
positive	this movie was very intense . . i can see why it was nimonated , but didn't win-too scary for the academy . i thought kath-z . jones-douglas was quite wonderful-i honestly thought she was a good guy . .
negative	this show sucked ! so does jay and silent bob ! what was even the storyline ? i got so bored during this crap that i failed to pay attention . the only thing that made it worth staring at for one second was chris rock . if he wasn't in it then it would have no plot whatsoever .
negative	i just want to know if the people that rated this movie good or great actually saw the movie . because if you have you relize that this movie is quite horiible . true , it does take new steps in animation , but i would have to say that this movie is extremely boring .
positive	this movie is great . helen hunt and jack nicholson have great chemistry and jack hits all of his lines perfectly . it keeps you very entertained .
positive	this movie kicked ass ! the whole time i was on the edge of my seat . the story was awesome . the writer had a good flow and the concept was perfectly horrific . i love the whole idea of cheating death and the resulting ( new ) future in which the characters are chased by death in the order they were seated in the plane . if you have never seen this movie , it is definitely worth your time ! ! ! !
negative	i couldn't believe how bad this movie stunk . i would have rather spent my money on seeing x2 again .
negative	get over it , this movie just plain old sucks . there is not one bit of good chemistry between cher and nicholas cage . it is so annoying , and he looks horrible . he didn't know how to act when he was young , and he proves it here . neither can cher , so let's get to the point peoples !
negative	better name for this movie 3 woman acting dumb stupid , and air headed ! ! ! movie sucked ! ! ! !
negative	this is possibly the worst movie of 2003 . . . even the alleged great talent of sean connery couldn't save it . . . a complete bomb that isn't even worth watching if someone gave it to you free . . .
positive	i find most of alfred hitchcock's work to be masterpiece material . psycho was a work of art and displayed the carnal nature that exists beneath the threshold of consciousness that often times flourishes in the overt actions of man .
positive	this is one of the most important films ever made . it showed the versatility of steven spielberg and his miraculous ability to make movies for the masses that not only please visually , but also intellectually . harrison ford give the performance of his career in this exciting , fast paced and thoughtful action film .
negative	biggest load of s * & t i've ever had the misfortune to see in my entire life
positive	amazingly charismatic work by nicholson . legendary script by robert towne . classic downer ending by roman polanski . irresistable . one caveat : this is not a movie for idiot couch potatoes . you have to pay attention to this one . the information is not spoon fed to you .
positive	what is great about this film is that it has to be the most perfectly cast movie of all time .
negative	misery was a horror movie ? i thought is was cheesy drama .
positive	i watched this movie at a time in my life when i was feeling very down . i moved to michigan away from my family in new york and was feeling very lonely because i couldn't be with them a christmas . i felt so good after watching it that i called my mom to discuss it .
positive	titanic is my favorite movie from this list because it has all the qualities of a great movie . the plot was interesting . there was humor , romance , suspense , and adventure .
positive	the most charming and well-animated movie i have ever seen . watch it once for the delightful story of devoted grandmotherly love , twice for the plethora of minor characters , a third time for the amazing animation ( especially the way light and shadow are used ) , and a fourth time because you can't get enough of it . maybe even a fifth , just to delight again in the triplets' culinary and orchestral eccentricities .
positive	i liked this movie which i thought i was going to hate . i can't relate to some of the scenarios ( talk about out an understatement ! ) but i still found the movie funny and provakative , to say the least .
positive	i am brave sir . . . shut up ! a classic funny . i was laughing straight for days and reciting passages . it took me a while to get what the knights of ni had changed their name to , but i got it . ekkiekkiekkibekongzooopboing .
positive	good vs . evil has never been done simpler-or better .
positive	it was movie that made you think about how much society hasn't changed and how labels are still put on people . also how that system takes control and tells you that you have to change to be acceptable . i haven't read the book yet but the movie was awesome and i loved it .
positive	the tempest in space . good fun .
negative	and i thought holy grail was bad . really unfunny .
negative	yet another execrable example of hollywood bastardising history . what is it with the us mainstream film industry that it can't help re-writing history to make the us come out the winner everytime . propaganda of the most sick making sort .
positive	* dink * * dink *
negative	mr . spealberg , please , stop doing that films . i only liked the first 20 minutes .
negative	the worst one of the entire series !
negative	this movie is terrible . it's not scary , or funny . all of the chucky movies are retarded , but this is definitely the worst . i wanted my five dollars back from the movie theatre because this movie sucked . it had no plot .
negative	massive disapointment . i am a huge fan of james patterson the author of all the alex cross detective novels and i must say in respect to the novel , this film is a travesty . this film is nothing like the biik which , in retrospect , is much more enjoyable and well thought out . this movie follows the book in no way except that the good guy is alex cross and the bad guy is gary sonja . this film grows into nothing . you end up feeling nothing for any character at all . and when ah ha moments fail to make you go ah ha . that is a sighn of failure . kiss the girls wasn't much better in that respect . anyway , i recommend reading the books . stay away from this film or any other film made of this brilliant series of books .
positive	so many levels
positive	scorcese's greatest film . it is simply one of the most visually beautiful films i've seen , and has an uncommon power .
negative	bambi is just plain , one of the worst disney movies ever made . it is so stupid , and the whole entire plot with a talking deer , and it's just so stupid . go shoot the deer and burn the video box .
positive	the best thing about this movie is edward furlong and edward norton
positive	worth the the wait to see hollywood produce an epic that isn't just a bunch of hype but a cinematic masterpiece .
positive	for anyone who has worked in the computer division of a large company can appreciate the humor in this movie . i loved this movie . we all know the boss , bill lumberg , the woman in the cubicle next to us with the most annoying voice , the memo's that everyone but you got , etc . . . alot of mindless humor , but also some intelligent things , you just have to be smart enough to catch it .
positive	certainly the best of them all , although i really liked a new nightmare . i have never forgot freddy and i think he is one of the best horror heroes ! no one parties like freddy ! i still remember the tv series they put out . great film and i love the part where nancy sees the dead girl in the body bag outside the class room door !
positive	this movie , gone in 60 seconds . . . kicks ass . . ! nicholas cage did some awesome high speed driving in this flick to the point of leaving me wondering . . . did he study under steve mcqueen ? ? ? is that it ? cause that's really saying something when it comes to driving a car as skillfully as that . now then , if you really want to sit on the tip of your chair in a cold sweat , watching this flick . . . simply go out and buy or rent a copy of it on dvd . . . do the hometheater and the works . it will blow you out of your seat . . . promise .
positive	this movie made my mother feel motion sickness ! it was awesome , as the space shuttle journeyed through space the stars seemed to pass right by us . it felt like we were moving through space , especially when we were in the space station and we turned about like the cameras . but the most awesome thing was looking at the earth from space . it was just so huge , that was the closest i would ever get to seeing the whole world from that point of view . it was breathtaking . plus the music that is played or not ; even the silence in that movie made a powerful impression .
negative	jackie , jackie , jackie . . . what on earth were you thinking ! ? ! he opted not to do his own stunts for this one , and it was a huge disappointment for many jackie chan fans . storyline was lame , but i wasn't expecting oscar material or anything . jennifer love hewitt just wasn't convincing as a scientist . it was almost painful to watch , and if there are any jackie chan fans out there who hasn't seen this , i highly suggest that you spare yourself the pain !
positive	good , faithful to the spirit of the book . several great performances , and fine cinematography . i actually prefer the extended version on video .
negative	this movie is boring and it is a amature horror movie this movie is so predictable .
positive	al pacino is one of my all time favorite actors . he is extremely talented and versatile . chris o'donnell is also spectacular as a new comer to hollywood when the movie first came out .
negative	ummmmm . . . . . . sucks the big one .
positive	stuart little has been underrated ! i rated it as great ( 5 stars ) because it's so clever . of course it's great for kids , but i think it's entertaining for parents and non-parents too . who can resist a mouse who goes with his adoptive mother to the toy store to buy doll clothes for a family dinner ?
positive	anyone expecting something really deep will be disappointed . i thought this movie was excellent . great action , great characters , . . . the characters weren't too serious , making fun of themselves , esp . natalie ( diaz ) . the movie was heaps of fun . go and see it !
positive	i have heard that the wizard of oz is the most watched american movie ever made . it is , indeed , an excellent movie and i can understand why it has earned such a reputation . it appeals to the sensibility of everyone , basically . it is probably the greatest family film ever made . i remember watching this movie when i was younger . while not one of my top favorites , the wizard of oz is an extremely entertaining movie and it deserves every bit of praise it has gotten .
positive	such an amazing movie ! far better than episodes 1 and 2 . the plot is very believable , as is the acting . some of the scenes were breathtaking . . . brilliantly written !
negative	one of those films where the violent scenes appeared to have been written by an emotionally disturbed person , who'd never seen anything .
positive	one of the most dark and gritty movies of the sci-fi genre , blade runner never ceases to impress . ridley scott's meticulous attention to detail makes for great cinema . the cinematography is something to behold . besides that it has a great script to back it up . rutger hauer is positively wicked as the villian roy batty . he has one of the best lines in movie history at the edn of the film . all my memories , lost like teardrops in the rain , time to die . harrison ford plays a good foil to hauer's insane villain . he's great as the seasoned pro deckart who has doubt about what he has to do to the replicants .
positive	as most of you have gathered from my weblist , i'm a huge , unabashed disney fan . this is truly my favorite and one of the best in my opinion . a sweet story paired with fantastic , unique voicework that brought to life unforgettable characters . and who can forget the wonderful , fun music ? i will admit sometimes disney films are blandly entertaining but this one had the spunk and fun to reach many age groups , creating a lasting cartoon classic .
positive	owen luvs his mama
positive	i can understand that some people would find the deliberate , methodical pace of this film as off-putting , but i think if you take it in the context of the social and class relationships of that time , you glean a new understanding of the film . to me , it is amazing the amount of restraint that hopkins and thompson bring to their roles , as would only be proper for those in service at the time . the juxtaposition of the unattainable romance of two downstairs people against the fading glory of the upstairs crowd is genius . especially interesting is the fact that the author , who so manages to capture the essence of the english class structure , is an expatriate japanese .
positive	this movie always makes me smile . great comedy and a great team ( belushi and akroyd ) set to a fantastic soundtrack .
positive	i love this ingenious movie ! the graphics were great and the plot kept me thinking until the end of the movie , which also kept me thinking , what is the next movie going to be like ? how will the next one thrill me ? this movie deffinately rubbed me the right way . the story was confusing and made me wonder if t his was really going on , but i just brushed it off and that feeling made me realize about 10 % more how smart the creation of this movie is . i would reccomend it to anybody that likes to keep wondering 'til the end . great movie !
positive	jaws is my second favorite movie of all time . i seem to have a thing for movies set in a clautrophobic environment . in this case , it is the orca on which the three men are hunting the shark . along with rear window , i can watch this film over and over again , and never tire of it !
positive	this was the first movie we watched in my school's film class this year , and i can't argue with its reputation as one of the greatest movies of all time : great performances from the whole cast , an interesting story , memorable characters , dozens of memorable lines , an intelligent and well-written screenplay with an ample amount of witty humor to boot . as the saying goes , they don't make 'em like this anymore , and it's a damn shame they don't .
positive	the wedding singer is an extremly well made movie , and it deserves so much credit for what went into it . it has the best lines , and adam sandler has an excellent role as robbie hart . it takes place in 1985 , in a small suburban town and robbie falls in love with julie , who is getting married to a rat , who is cheating on her , but he's rich and robbie's a poor wedding singer , but julie likes robbie better but is too nervous to tell him .
positive	great movie for kids and adults . very funny ! ! !
positive	wow
positive	a great movie , well done . proves to the naysayers just how much love he had for us . note to samthecoolbear don't worry about ralph , he makes fun of everybody . that's his way . it makes him feel good about himself i guess ?
positive	a great achievement . i know some people criticize it for deviating from the book , but i don't know one movie that doesn't . i thought they caught the spirit of dumas' book eloquently .
positive	i really didn't think i would like this movie when i first started watching it . it just didn't look that good . but the more i watched the more i enjoyed it , and i was laughing out loud at some of the comedy . the music's not bad either . a pleasant surprise .
positive	hands down the best trek film of all time .
positive	there is so much tosee in this , just seeing once isn't enough . i have seen it more times than i care to count , but every now and then i see something i missed before . we all know where the yellow brick road goes , but i wonder about the that red brick road that starts in the circle with it . where does that go ?
positive	cusack is great !
positive	sexystreif wouldn't know her a * * from a hole in the ground . this is perhaps the most inspired , densely-packed comedy ever in film history ! the marx bros are the greatest vaudeville comedy team of all-time , and this was their finest , a pure , all-comedy comedy ! no filler whatsoever ! where do i begin ? how about when they all dress up as groucho in his bedgown ? how about my glass of water ? ok , i give up - how about your glass of water ? what about the mirror scene ? if you didn't enjoy that , you don't know what comedy is ! and the final battle scene is one of the funniest scenes i ever saw ! it's also a great anti-war movie - a farce in the spirit of strangelove and great dictator . hands down , the marx bros are true comic legends , and this movie is why ! one of my all-time greatest movies ever .
positive	this is the most memorable movie i have ever seen !
positive	two wonderful actors ! ! ! with such weak characters at the beginning , they make people you wanna help and support in their adventures .
positive	ralph macchio kicks all kinds of 80's ass . also , mr . miyagi played an integral role in the acceptance of asians in society today .
positive	i love this movie . its funny , helps me cheer up on bad days . david chapelle rocks . it didnt take itself too seriously and is easy to enjoy .
positive	my fair lady . what a great movie . well acted by all and well done . i wish they just would have let audrey hepburn sing her own songs . the only down part of the movie is i can tell someone else is singing for her . otherwise , a terrific movie !
negative	the movie to see of the year , at least , according to the critics who didn't pan this movie . the movie follows around a pervert of a man , his premiscious daughter and her friend that is the same way , his wife in an affair , a racist neighbor and his ditsy wife , this one has no one with any sense of morals anywhere in it ! the film is laced with graphic descriptions of sexual activity , profanity , nudity , drug use , amoral attitdues , and tons of other stuff that shouldn't be in any movie . don't even accept this one for cash--unless you tape something over it like i love lucy , andy griffith show or a movie like gus or emperor's new groove .
positive	this is what a family movie should be-- smart , witty , non-gratuitous , and made for the whole family . great stuff for adults , great stuff for young people . great stuff ! i wish there were a whole lot more movies like the princess bride .
negative	it wasn't even scary , nothing in the movie to me would even classify as a horror movie . the best part of the movie sucked , and that was supposed to be the best scene in the movie .
positive	this movie is truly an incredible piece of art . i can not say this movie was an enjoyable , but it is both unforgetable and haunting . while some people reviewed this talking about the lack of nudity , that is totally not what this movie is about . the acting is incredible , and elly burstyn should have won an oscar for this . also , the music is so important to this movie , especially in creating the mood . this includes the incredibly stunning last ten minutes . this is definetly a director we should be expecting great things from in the future .
positive	my favorite movie of all time . steve martin and john candy made a terrific pair in this movie . i laugh my hind-end off every time i watch it .
negative	not fit to hold wrath of khan's jockstrap . the only reason this movie ( or any of the later movies , especially the old trek / tng crossovers ) succeed is that there is a nation of pasty , maladjusted trekkies out there sustaining that industry from the comfort of their parents' basements . i like trek too , especially because it is such a deeply detailed subject , but these movies are just pander .
positive	this movie is awesome and conner and murphy are fine as hell and the old bartender is the man ! ! ! ! ! and always remember . . . don't cross the road if you can't get out of the kitchen !
negative	yawn . . . i saw this movie when i was eight and it totally bored me to death . . . i almost fell asleep ! however my 2 something year old stepbrother is still terrified that he's gonna get possesed .
positive	this is a classic with one of the best soundtracks of all time . patrick swayze is hot and the dancing is really entertaining . the plot is interesting as well . i carried a watermelon , a line you will never forget .
positive	the more you watch this movie the better it gets . it starts out as a two-star but is elevated with hidden details , visual and audio stimulation , along with a hidden desire to stumble upon a paradise such as this .
positive	one of the few movies from my childhood which i remember with such fondness . everything that happens inside the factory is completely mesmerizing and leaves memories still vivid many years later . teaches some good lessons to children but also delights them with the wonders within the factory . the cast is wonderful .
positive	this movie has it all ! ! ! 3 independant women who not only look hot 24 / 7 they also have the intelligence and ability to back it up , not to mention the fact they can seriously kick ass ! ! ! 10 out of 10 made me proud to be a woman cameron diaz brought new meaning to the robot . absolutely love this movie ! !
positive	this is a very well done sci-fi flick . it has a fascinating premise which is explored well and it has great special effects . it is also a horror movie , however , and has some really upsetting and gruesome scenes .
positive	who can compete with it it's a classic i love it how he was scared of snakes .
positive	awesome movie ! inspires lots of philosophical conversations .
positive	* hahahahaha *
positive	kevin smith's first effort is full of terrific dialogue that is his trademark . the first of a series that includes mallrats , chasing amy , and dogma . for adults only ; watch them all for a movie night !
positive	kevin smith's first and to date best film from his view askewniverse . the film is an incrediblly low budget , black and white breakthrough film the centers on dante , who is called in to work when he is not schedueled , at the local covinenece store . the film takes place over one work day and we join dante in a cross roads of sorts in his life . along the way we meet a list of original and bizarre characters . jay and silent bob make their big screen dabut and have been the only constant in every view askew film . veronica , dante's current squeez who gives more filatio than mos hardened porn starletts . a never ending bombardment of weirdo customers an ranal ( my favorite smith character ever written next to brody ) dante's co-worker at the next door video store . clerk is in my opinion one of the funniestand most honest films ever made . original and funnier than hell . clerks is highly highly highly recommended .
positive	lopez is a great actress . the special effects were amazing . i really got into the story plot .
positive	gene wilder as dr . frankenstien is almost perfect casting . marty feldman did a terrific job as igor . cloris leachman did a wonderful job as the maidservant frau buchler ( did i just hear a horse whinney ? ? ) . this movie was funny when it was first released , and it has aged well . there are literally hundreds of tiny jokes you miss the first time you watch , but catch with each successive showing . defintly five stars ! ! ! ! !
positive	since this movie was billed as a laugh a minute sandler flick , it attracted the wrong audience . but it's actually one of my favorite romantic comedies . i've seen it a bunch of times , and it's really adorable , but most definitly a chick flick .
negative	this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen in my life . i didn't mind the idea of making a modern romeo and juliet , but this movie bombed it badily . who had the stupid idea of using the old language with the modern movie ? nothing from this movie can be saved except to say that it was crap .
positive	simply genious !
positive	drug induced , but good .
positive	sassy , sexy , and provocative film has the best direction of the year , and offers fine performances .
positive	fun for parents and kids .
positive	the beginning of the movie looks like another scary-teen movie , but it's not ! very nice act , and very nice plot .
positive	one of the best black comedies of the progressive director generation of the late 60's early 70's . satirical and sometimes ironic , h m is a great example of a movie made from the 60's generation perspective without being overtly hippie . a young upper class man , harold , living with his cold and preoccupied mother has developed an obsession with death . to elicit an emotional response from his mother ( once seen years earlier when she believed him killed ) he sets up mock suicide attempts of varying complexities . by the time we see his current attempts his mother has become apathetic and even a bit annoyed with his behavior . he spends his free time attending anonymous funerals at which he first meets maude . over the course of the movie we see how a 79 year old free spirit changes the world of this sheltered boy / man .
positive	it's a beautiful movie -- probably not my favourite of the early disney movies , but near the top of the list . the evil queen is one of disney's best villains . the more recent disney creations , churned out at the rate of a couple per year , can't even come close to the beauty and magic of the older ones . children today are being shortchanged .
positive	when i first saw mary poppins i was four years old and loved the songs and the magic . julie andrews is fabulous as the practically perfect eponymous heroine . i am now 21 and still love mary poppins , it is still my favourite film , and any film that can captivate different generations after almost half a century has to be something special . as a child you will love the energy and enthusiasm of the film , it's playful creativity and the way that it brings out the child in each character . as an adult you will appreciate a depth to the story that is rare in children's movies , the redemption of the father figure is truly touching and david tomlinson's performance is incredible . much of the movie is aimed at pleasing all generations . this is the one movie which can truly be called a family picture . there can be no better advert for disney and for children's films than mary poppins . splendid , splendid !
positive	i think that this was good as far as the thrill and suspense . i give this a 5 because i really think that it was action packed . i thought the movie was really worth seeing .
positive	i'm a sucker for zombie movies , and this one is by far the best . real characters , great acting , scary zombies , and a realistic solution to an unreal problem . definitely worth it to rent or buy at any price .
positive	wes craven's scream brought about a much needed horror movie revolution . it was definitely not the typical slasher flick . the characters were unique , especially the movie buff guy . his comments poked fun at horror movies . the combination of gore , sly remarks , and popular actors and actresses made this movie a success .
positive	de niro kicks ass . one of his best roles . he's a complete lunatic nut .
positive	the movie like the books was surprisingly good .
positive	the best thriller to come out in ages . i thought films like this had died out a long time ago . joy ride has proven me wrong . this film had me crouched in my chair and biting my nails through some of the coolest suspence filled moments i have ever experienced . i would go as far as to compare this to hitchcock . a perfect blend of hard edged humor and heart pounding suspence and terror make this one of the best thrillers i have ever seen . a great cast and an original story as well as beautiful directing help to bring this film to full speed life . steve zahn is excellent as usual . paul walker prooves himself to be a fairly good action type and leelee sobeieski makes the most of a underwritten yet believable role . ( anyone else notice her high beams are on in about every damn shot ? ? ? ) a great film that relies on sheer terror rather than a bloody stump . like the great alfred hitchcock once said , i want to torture my audience as much as possible . believe me , you will be tortured in the most wonderful ways imaginable . joy ride deliverse the goods . highly highly recommended !
positive	this movie is about everything - life after death , belief in heaven and hell , the breakdown in the 60s 70s of the american family , the effect of puberty on a child and a parent , loss of faith , christianity's beginnings ( the beginning sequence in the middle east is a wonderful kubrickian omen that evil is coming - like the old traditions of the east are cursing the values of the west ) , what medicine doesn't know about the brain , and perhaps most disturbing , the sexuality of a pubescent . i think that's the one that bothers people the most . i'm stunned that so much taboo went into this movie . it's an amazing movie . it still makes me very uneasy to watch it .
positive	i love this film , it's a classic , it's so funny and dory is the best !
negative	i haven't detested a movie so much in a long time ; while its good at holding your attention , it fails horribly at being the important movie it sets out to be . it winds up being a confused muddle : lives are tedious until you delve into perverse ? there is much to be appreciated in our everyday lives ? which one is it , guys ? by trying to straddle both with characters that are absolute cartoons , it comes across as dishonest and shallow .
positive	i've always thought that all fantasy movies were stupid & a waste of time to watch . but since the lord of the rings i've developed a greater respect & liking toward those type of movies . this last lord of the rings was the best ever ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it deserved all of the oscars ! go new zealand ! !
positive	this has got to be one of the best war movies of all time . it beats out the patriot by a long shot . this film had all the goods nad presented a realistic re-enactment of the rise and fall of the 54th massachusetts regiment led by col . robert gould shaw . as a lover of history , i knew that i had to see this movie when i first heard about it , and i was not disappointed . the characters were all perfectly developed , and the buildup to the climax was phenominal . not to mention the wonderful acting by the all-star cast which included matthew broderick , denzel washington , morgan freeman , cary elwes , jay o'sanders and others . i enjoyed seeing each of the characters evlve in their own way : espescially that of denzel washington , whose character was so cynical , hateful and spiteful at the beginning but in the end we learned his true feelings of respect for the brave men fighting beside him . glory is a moving , inspirational film which shows that a true patriot is one who defends his country even when it had wronged him . a true patriot is one who tries to fix the wrong . and that is exactly what the men of the 54th massachusetts regiment helped do . a great movie !
positive	too funny , action scenes were off the hook , cannot wait for a part three . i love will smith and martin lawrence . . . bad boys , bad boys , what you gonna do . . . -go see it , it is worth the money . -victrolalights-
positive	e t was one of the best movies ever . the music was great , a great plot line , and the e t effects were excellent . the scenes toward the end while make you want to cry while those toward the beginning are scary . i like the 2002 20th anniversary special edition version better than the original version .
positive	marilyn monroe's best performance
negative	not a star trek fan- never liked it . it's so boring . never liked the plot of it .
positive	another masterpiece in spielberg's massive collection of great titles . e . t . is an 80's icon .
positive	the best horror movie , and one of the best movies of all time . the movie represents a true test of faith , and it illustrates one of the most constant battles in life -- faith vs science .
positive	beast bond . aliza gur was hot but who wouldve won between the two female fighters .
positive	dude , this movie was hilarious ! ! ! i loved it . the laughing demon is great , i do a wonderful imitation . it is definately one of the better low budget films i have ever seen , even if ashley is a sissy girl who screams alot .
positive	words cannot describe how much i love this movie . this is provably my favorite b-movie ever . bruce campbell is my hero . sam raimi is a genius . ok people who watch this movie and are expecting to be scared are to be sorely dissapointed , because this movie is in no way scary . this movie is hilarious . for anyone with a dark sense of humor , you need to see this movie . it is the perfect blend of horror and comedy . the evil dead trilogy is the best trilogy in the history of moviemaking , and army of darkness is the perfect way to end it all . great acting ( you rule bruce ! ) , great one-liners and catch phrases , and and well , an all out great movie . highly highly recomended ! ! !
positive	i enjoyed seeing female actors in strong roles . the movie was a good vehicle for julia roberts to strut her stuff .
positive	an absolutely excellent and surprising movie with screenbreaking vibes between basinger and crowe ! a thrilling story , excellent actors , great music : bravo to the director curtis hanson
positive	james and the giant peach is an extremly well done movie based on the hit children's novel written by roald dahl . it's about a young boy named james , whose parents are eaten by a hippo in the sky , and his 2 evil aunts are left to take care of him . he finds a giant peach , that he goes into , and he makes friends with a group of giant bugs . it may sound , weird but this movie is great .
positive	how can you not like jay and silent bob . the best comedy duo since cheech and chong . reconize
positive	michael moores film fahrenheit 9 / 11 gives his left leaning slant on the bush adminstration and 9 / 11 , just as rush and oreilly and hannity , etc . , give their right leaning slant on those topics every day on the radio and tv . i think moores slant is closer to the truth . there is no doubt in my mind that bush has screwed us up royally . i cannot remember a time in which there was so much animosity toward america around the globe . do you know that the day after 9 / 11 there were candlelight vigils being held in iran in sorrow and respect for our tragedy ? we had the whole world behind us , even after we went into afghanistan , an action that most americans , myself included , felt was justifiable and appropriate . the war in iraq turned all of that good will into hatred . it has alienated former allies . it has divided our nation . it has taken the lives of hundreds of fine american servicemen and women . it has also ruined the lives of thousands of others who have been maimed , both physically and psychologically . it has also taken the lives of thousands of innocent iraqi civilians . the financial cost of the war is tremendous and will certainly have lasting implications for our economy . and what is the big reward for our efforts ? the removal from power of a murderous tyrant whom had already been so marginalized by the gulf war that he posed no real threat to us or our allies . and the iraqi people are so grateful for our intervention on their behalf that they are attempting to kill our soldiers every chance they get . fahrenheit 9 / 11 put a spotlight on certain issues which have been rather puzzling to me , such as , why the delayed and seemingly half-hearted attempt at capturing osama bin laden ? why did we shift our focus from al qaeda , the extremist muslim organization responsible for the 9 / 11 attack , to iraq , a secular state with virtually no ties to bin laden or al qaeda ? moores film might have you believe that the answer to those questions could be big money and power . i dont know that i ascribe to all of the conspiracy theories surrounding the relationships between the bush administration and the saudis , or the role of large american corporations in the rebuilding of iraq and its prized oil reserves , but i can tell you it all looks and smells very bad . if that sounds cynical , let me just remind you of the corrupting role that big money and power played in the recent implosion of our friends at enron . in my opinion , this war has become a national tragedy for which the bush administration must be voted out of office . if mr . moores film helps accomplish this goal , than he is a hero in my estimation .
positive	one of the best movies of recent years . it's not a laugh-out-loud comedy like many on this list , but its hilarious in parts and engaging throughout . a real life look at real guys . in some ways , swingers is like a male version of fried green tomatos or one of those other quintessential chick movies . after all , this is all about how four 20-something guys cope with a friend that's lovesick and depressed . while i know some female viewers get turned off by little flashes of misogyny , the more important message of the movie is about the quirks of male friendship , and how friends rally to help each other in non-obvious ways .
positive	cute and irresistable movie . bruce willis makes it impossible for me not to love his acting . i liked the topic , and was glad i saw it . it was a movie for both kids and adults .
positive	my dream : i wish i was a midieval knight . it was very accurate to king arthur too . also had great actors .
positive	luved it yeah baby ! ! to see kirsten d in a yummy cl uniform wow ! ! that my feinds is film making ! ! the only dumb point was to make it a race issue with 'those black chix' who were always in a sour combative mood , who cares who steals dance moves ? ? ? i went to see kirsten d jump around and wow did she deliver ! ! the other girl was a major cupcake also mmmmmmmmm but her dufus brother playing air gee-tar was lame . -----todd michael wiseman ohio univ college of film cinematography
positive	the film is so great !
positive	i was really looking forward to seeing this movie and my expectations were unmistakingly rewarded . although i would have liked to have seen more races , what lacked in action made up for in cars , wow i saw some amazing machines esspecially the one that paul walker's character drives ( the bright green beauty ) that is eventually destroyed by a very convincing enemy johnny . the plot was a little slow and the ending was not what i hoped , but again vin diesel made up for that . i don't believe the director could have chosen a better king of the road . i'm really looking forward to the sequel .
positive	great , a little creepy and tense . . . .
positive	i love the princess bride and everything about it . the casting was brilliant and i can't imagine anybody playing the parts better than the original cast . cary elwes was great as the somewhat dry , intelligent wesley / dread pirate roberts . robin wright was wonderful as the beautiful if not naive buttercup and all of the supporting actors were amazing . wallace shawn was hilarious as vizzini and he was so mean you just love to hate him . the on set filming gave the movie a sort of charm that can never be captured in a studio . all in all , great film with something for everyone .
positive	nice movie . parents if you took your kids to see this movie in the theaters and they like it chirstmas is coming . or if they haven't seen it , this makes a perfect movie .
positive	this is the loveliest film i've seen in a long time . a poetic testament to what is real in every human heart . kevin spacey is wonderful as always , and chris cooper , who doesn't get enough work in films , is also excellent . keep an eye on wes bentley . this kid is going to be major .
positive	this movie was amzing . that pretty much covers it .
positive	this movie was excellent ! the american president had it all- good plot , great acting and great directing by rob reiner . i origionally thought that michael douglas , given his filmmaking history and playing in movies like fatal attraction , would not be a good choice to play the president- but boy was i wrong . he brought a sense of charm to the film . michael j . fox was great as the paranoid louis rothschild . martin sheen was also great as aj . annette benning and michael douglas have such chemistry together on screen . a great movie !
negative	what was the point of this movie other than to cash in on beatlemania ? no plot , weak soundtrack , and worst of all , john's silliness .
positive	this movie rocked ! tom cruise and remee zellweger are phenomenal , and the theme song , secret garden with the cleverly placed dialouge is awesome !
positive	a great movie to wach .
positive	what's not to like about bette davis chewing up scenery and making joan crawford miserable ? fantastic movie . great performances by all concerned .
positive	awsome movie ! i could watch it a 10000 times and still love it
positive	i need to get hold of a knitting pattern that he had on with reindeer on in his christmas film anyone know where i can obtain one please
negative	oh enough already ! this isn't 1977 anymore . after reading naturallyyou's review i felt like i was in a disco hell time warp . give me a break . . . . you should be dancing , jive talkin . . . . man please ! stereo types and abusing women was fever the producer had in making film for the gutter !
positive	this is probably the first comedy i have seen in theatres this year that was actually worth watching . it was great ! i laughed all the way thru this one . queen latifah is exactly as she is called in this movie . . she is the one and only cocoa goddess . she definately stood out in this movie ! as for steve martin , i never loved him or anything , and he is definately showing his age in this one . but regardless , the movie was hilarious and i can't wait to buy it on dvd .
negative	this has got to be one of the stupidest , most unfunny piece or tripe i have ever seen . grodin and de niro whould have known better than to make a turkey like this one . when i see it scheduled on tv , i find something else to do , so i won't turn on the tv and accidently see this assinine movie . i absolutly hate it .
negative	stupid ! i wish we could give a 0 rating !
negative	could this movie get any worse ?
negative	i thought this movie was so boring it lacked substance and character
positive	appealing to both men and women . has a great cast and was a hollywood success story for matt damon and ben affleck .
positive	excellent actors and a very unusual plot and storyline which keeps you glued to it .
positive	i liked this movie ! john travolta's a god ! i don't exactly know what it was , maybe it was hally barry's tits , cool cars , or the good action but i really liked it .
positive	quentin tarntino is a genius . in his first major hollywood film , he gathers an awesome cast to go along with his vague writing and creative directing .
positive	what an amazing film ! definatly in the top five movies of all time in my book . mel gibson did an amazing job acting and directing . has amazing epic battle seguences and an overwhelmingly inspiring . a story of an orphan boy that was raised byb his uncle . when the horrible king longshanks comes into power he is forced to fight for something he has never had freedom . his will for freedom and his hate for the king drive him towards battle and inspiror his men . a masterpiece of a film full of felt emotion . ( rated r for strong graphic violence , language ; 2 f-bombs , and sexual content including nudity . )
positive	probably the best horror movie ever . a wonderful cast with an added blend of excellent one-liners from jack nicholson . very creepy moments throughout the film include the kitchen of the overlook hotel and the two young female twins who visit the little boy while riding his big wheel down the hallways . very quiet moments throughout the film added to the terror
positive	one of . . . if not carrey's best movie . the plot itself is phenominal . also . . . the best outtakes from any movie ever . if you have not had the pleasure of watching it , i advise you do .
positive	it was sooooooooooooooooo good . jake looked sooooooooooooooooo hot in it ! ! they should have more goth pics of him on the net . i cant find them n / e where
positive	my best friend told me that quills was an amazing movie , but i only thought he said that because it was about sex . however , my boyfriend and i saw it together and were both in tears at the end . a masterful piece , it takes somewhat vulgar bubject matter and transforms it into a powerful story of love , sanity , and censorship . the squeamish should not attend , but others should . the movie speaks for itself .
positive	this movie is another example of a classic comic book excellently transformed into a motion picture blockbuster . featuring classic characters from the comic , it is another good example of a comic cleanly and solidly transformed into a great motion picture . though there are some clear disimilarities ( wolverine is much taller than his comic book character , and rogue is clearly younger than she is as portrayed in the comic ) and many changes have been clearly seen in the movie , it is still consistently a great movie , showing smooth transition from comic book to movie sequence .
negative	l . . . o . . . l ! from now on , the title anaconda can only preceed a porno flick . these movies are terrible .
positive	this was one of the greatest movies ever in my opinion . with the quick action from robbery , gun shooting , great costumes , and it's all star cast , this movie had me on the edge of my seat through the whole movie .
positive	adam is the best ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
positive	christmas classic . the feel-good movie of the millenium . i dare you not to cry !
negative	this is a terrible film . direction is inept , everyone looks as though they are going through the motions . cameron diaz is the shining light that burns bright in this foul stench of a film . donnot waste your money on this film . unless you like your films with inpenetrable dialogue , risible directing and poor editing . what was bill murray thinking ? ? ? ? ? ?
positive	one of the few movies that i love just as much now as i did when i was kid . when i was younger i was captivated by the candy and the mystery of the chocolate factory . as an adult i love this movie because it is absolutely hilarious , the songs are so nutty and memorable and because gene wilder was absolutely brilliant playing willy wonka . a timeless classic that will be cherished for years to come .
positive	great soundtrack ! great lines ! great cast ! . . . hello can we say matt in the peach pants ! ! ! ! ! !
positive	in years to come people will study this like we do shakespeare . . . god the future will be more fun
positive	a brilliant parody of the early movies , this is brooks at his best .
positive	excellent movie . the thing that got me hooked was the dreaminess of it . the music flowed . the lighting contrasts were genious . the way the mood changed from being dreamy to eery . although strange at times , it depicts perfectly how teenagers can feel at times . sofia coppola's talent really becomes obvious in this dramatic movie . . . you're a stone fox . .
positive	if a horror movie is able install within you an errie persence and surprise you throughout the picture , it has accomplished its main purpose . the exorcist is the prime example of what a good horror movie should be . it also helps that the picutre has a reasonable , or dare i say , good plot and brilliant acting ( which is also emcompassed inside the exorcist ) . the film is mesmorizing all the way through . only few can hold a candle to this great movie classic .
positive	i really enjoyed this movie . it was so funny !
positive	this was such a great movie and one of my alltime favorite movies . james stewart always blows me away and this is chareceter is absoultely amazing . i would never be able to stand on my feet for a whole 48 hours was it ? just to stand up to something he believe in , he was incredible . i wish we had more politicians like mr . smith in our days today !
positive	its a great movie . tom hanks is so believable that you are beginning to think that the script or maybe the original novel was written with him in mind . director robert zemeckis pulled out all stops for crafting a superb film . robin wright was excellent , and so was computer enhanced gary sinise . this movie by the way has more special effects than the final part of star wars trilogy the return of jedi . all thanks to people in lucasart , whose magic is woven seamlessly into the movie . its not just a space opera or fantasy flick . its one of those movies where s / fx are mutating out reality . but anyways , i think forrest gump is a great movie .
negative	why ? why did they make this movie ? what was going on in the filmmakers mind . i feel very sorry for myself for not listening to my friends advice when they warned me about not seeing battlefield earth . this movie sucks . no stars .
positive	i don't know why , but i loved this movie . probably because i loved the blond geeky girls who are actually beautiful . kind of reminded me of myself .
positive	this must be one of the best films tom cruise has ever been in . his character is very realistic and has depth . renee zellweger is very convincing as a young single mother - and the boy who plays her son is outstanding as well . i can't think of a single actor in the film who isn't particularly good - and thats rare . the movie runs along very smoothly and the music matches the tempo of it . it reflects that society now works too hard and often forgets that there are other things in life to think and enjoy . it also points out that in the workplace , you can never really know what people think about you . i love this film , when i want to feel soppy and realise that what i have in life is so amazing ( my partner , our flat , and just about everything ) and i am so lucky .
positive	my favorite ! ! talented actors and actresses . great screenplay ! this is the best movie adaptation of jane austen's works . the other great film adaptation of her work is a e's pride and prejudice .
positive	this film is only for jim carrey . who could play this role charlie / hank except jim ? the hard words were just cute . . . renee zellweger was cute too . irene p . waters was the very different image prepared to that role in jerry maguire . she showed she could even keep up with jim carrey . her charm in this film was enough to attract his instinct . . .
positive	i only saw it in french , which was pretty fun , so i got to make up what they were saying , twas cool . . . oh , and the music was cool too . . . .
positive	nothing comes close in sci-fi movies . classic good vs evil . cant wait for the remaining movies to come out . george is da man . may the force be with you all .
positive	i thought that this movie was excellent . i was able to follow everything that happened . i was a little sad that they didnt use the part with the rat from the book . it was awsome and i will see it again .
positive	roberto benigni was the greatest comic actor of his day ( he makes dopes like adam sandler look like amateurs ) . then he became afflicted with the fatal disease all-too-common among great comedians : the wish to be a 'serious' actor , working in 'serious' movies . too bad . this one is probably his funniest , but 'the monster' is pretty good too .
negative	dude wheres the dumb
positive	i went to see this at the cinema with my friend for my 19th b'day ( my partner was on holiday at the time - sob ! ) and we totally loved it . the best bit were definately the cats - i wasn't too keen on the rest . the main merit for this film is the computer graphics and a few witty lines , but i still think its a fun nonsensical film .
positive	i love this movie .
positive	i love this movie .
negative	i have not seen a film this terrible since i still know what you did last summer . this film is horrid . absolutly terrible . the spoofing makes no sense and it way too fixated on placing sh * t on people . whether it is talking about pooping on someone for sexual plaeasur or actually exploding gallons of fresh sh * t all over people . where does all the sh * t come from ? this was never in the breakfast club or she's all that . i felt like i had flushed my hard earned bucks down the toilet and then had it explode all over me with sh * t . the only true moment of comedy comes with . . . jesus . . . . there are no funny moments . i had to force my laughter each time something was supposed to be comical . what a waste of a good genre to spoof .
positive	i'm a big fan of tolkien . i have read most of his books . even though they changed some things from the book , this movie was amazing . one of the best movies i have ever seen .
positive	instant classic . the film had a great cast ( sean connery and harrison ford ) . the story was very well written . this film will be watched for decades .
positive	it's a kind of ma-gic ! absolutely fab . highlander was one of the only real quality fantasies i've ever seen . with a fantastic soundtrack written by queen ( aka a kind of magic ) and a well-thought plot , i enjoyed the film from beginning to end . i recommend it to everyone , and no , it's not just because of the soundtrack . although the songs one year of love and hammer to fall are two of my favorites . the story of an immortal scotsman , complete with a few cool special effects , gets a five-star automatic . take care , everyone !
positive	i truly can t say anything bad about this movie . its simply wonderful . period . its definitely my favorite disney movie . anyone who bashes this movie has either 1- never seen it , or 2- has no taste whatsoever . a + +
positive	rob and the musical morons are very funny . well scripted , brilliant performance by cusack , and a good soundtrack . clever and witty .
positive	the english patient is a superb movie . ralph fiennes is a great actor . the entire cast is great . even though the movie is long , the love story is worth it .
negative	a good sci-fi movie . i grow tired of people constantly focusing on the sex scene & forgetting about how badly the main characters treated their children . the sex scene was very sloppy & hallie looked drugged up in ecstasy which is something i never expected her look like . this woman harbours such tremendous hypocrisy when she states hollywood is racist when she turns around & protrays some poor needy black woman who is willing to sleep with a racist . my god where is the bottom & i am glad her mom is white .
positive	i was surprised that i liked this one as much as i did . each fish had it's own unique personality as well as their own dysfunctions . it was a kids' movie but it wasn't sugary sweet .
positive	a great movie ! i thought the whole cast was great . it is listed as a drama , but it had a number of hillarious scenes in the movie . i espcially loved the scene with shelby's wedding and the red velvet cake shaped like an amarillo . and it is not just a movie for chicks ! this movie will make you laugh and cry , just a really good movie .
positive	this is one of those movies that comes along once in a while and hits the nail on the head and creates a genre . sometimes a low budget flick with a no-name cast does it--this is one of those . it is not as violent as advertised and does have some sterotypes , i . e . crazed southern inbred backwoods family . but put your skepticism aside and revel in the horror and suspense of the effort .
positive	my 2nd favorite movie of all time . a must see movie ? -scarface
positive	jim carrey is impressive in this hilarious movie . nice to see carrey do something more than just physical comedy . it had all the elements of a great movie .
positive	i've never seen another movie quite like this one . it keeps you guessing the whole time and just when you think you've got it figured out everything changes . by far the best ending ever .
positive	richly deserving its accolades . i would venture to say clint deserved the best actor oscar , but he did get best director . though it looks like a boxing movie , it is so much more than that . you need to see it . i'd put it in my all-time top-10 and probably the best picture since forest gump .
negative	three words describe this movie to me - dull , dull , dull . and it was saying a lot for me to get this impression because i first saw it when i still enjoyed westerns and still didn t have a clue as to how little this folklore had to do with reality . and i especially enjoyed the ones that had a love story going on . however , i just could not take the practically comatose subtlety of gary cooper s low-key acting style . he not only put me to sleep but he also looked more like ice princess grace kelley s father than her hubby . unfortunately , unlike the western genre , this denial of masculine age and the pairing of old dudes with young chicks still persists in hollywood . and , it still seems like exactly what it is a pathetic attempt to make the man feel and look younger . oh , and by the way - it still doesn t work .
negative	kirsten dunst , your 15 minutes are just about up . . .
positive	wow , i didn't think this movie would be on the list . on my obscure but cool list , i had to watch that movie three times ( thank god for cable tv ) at age eleven before i understood what the hell was going on . john lithgow was outstanding , especially the way he would say john bigbooty with that crazy accent .
negative	don't watch this movie !
positive	one of hitchcock's most influential and perspective altering movies ; truly showed the emotional power of the moving image
positive	i believe if eveyone saw this movie , the country would be a better place . this movie truly made me think ! everyone should see this movie !
negative	i know garfield and this isn't it . it's just a boring , generic , anaemic kids movie . garfield looks like c * * * , most of the acting is poor ( especially jennifer love hewitt , who acts so forced ) and the plot is not true to the comic . for example , garfield hates odie . he doesn't become friends with him like he does here . liz also hates jon . any date they went on in the comic strip was a disaster . here , they like each other . the only acceptable performance is from bill murray as garfield . the villain is generic kiddy c * * * i've seen a thousand times over , and is acted out as such . the rescue is both unoriginal and unexciting . the rest of the animals are just normal animals , which looks kind of cheap and they are only related to the comic by name ( for example , arlene doesn't appear to be garfield's girlfriend ) . in conclusion , if you're a garfield fan , don't see this . garfield : the movie could have been interesting to watch , but it just isn't . i like the comic . i hate this movie . 1 / 5 stars - you've been warned
positive	this movie has made film noir hip again , plus it has a cleverly woven storyline . guy pierce shines in this film ! !
positive	ok , so it is a little bit cheesy , but , it is a well told story and has quite a few surprizes ! the concept is quite different and some of the scenes are a bit disturbing . i have never seen a movie quite like it and it resides in my top 25 movies of all time .
positive	this is one of the only two movies that have ever really frightened me . i saw this in second grade it genuenly took my nerves to the breaking point . i finally got up the nerve to see it again in sixth grade and realized this is one of the better haunted house stories ever put to film . written and produced by steven speilberg and directed by the master of the macabre tobe hooper the genius behind the texas chainsaw massacre . this film is not just about fright but about family as well . it is as heart warming and funny as it is scary . i highky recommend this film .
positive	this is a movie that any true and dedicated movie fan should watch . it is one of the finest movies in terms of character and story ever put on screen . superb performances by al pacino , james caan , marlon brando , robert duval , john cazale and more . the movie is dark , gritty and violent the way it should be . it just isn't about the mafia , it's about a family . the godfather and the godfather part ii is recommended to anyone who likes to watch great art .
negative	i thought this movie was a waste of time . the acting was ok , but the story line was was ridiculous . what was w / the singing ? i don't think i could have stood another minute of tom cruise singing . his caracter was incredibly annoying . i can't picture tom as a womanizer .
positive	the best of the trilogy for sure ! really well made . . . schwartzy is always cool
negative	yo matt likes this move so it must suck ! ! ! ! ! !
negative	this was not a horror movie . i got so bored i couldn't finish watching it . blah .
positive	like i said b4 sandler and berrymore make a great comedy movie . . . with adams good singing in this movie it made it too good to be true !
positive	great movie ! i felt like they were right next to me . it has an amazing cast including jenna elfman , dave foley , all of the simpsons , woody allen , and sharon stone . great movie !
positive	i havent seen this since i was a kid , but at that time it was the scariest thing i ever saw .
positive	monsters , inc . was a great movie . i saw it at least three times ! i would recommend this movie to everyone .
positive	charlie's angels 2 is a great movie . it's perfect for everybody . it has a little bit of everything- action , romance , suspense , drama , comedy ( cameron diaz is hilarious ! ) and lots of skin for the guys . go see it .
positive	very funny , i saw it in the movies and adam sandler is a pothead .
positive	cary grant is so funny in his acting expressions . those old ladies had tears falling .
positive	i'm giving about a boy five stars simply because watching it was such an enjoyable experience . the movie is about a swinging bachelor ( played by hugh grant ) who becomes involved in a young boy's life and , as a result , learns to see life in a different way . the movie was sweet without being saccharine , and it was filled with funny scenes . hugh grant , an actor i usually avoid , was outstanding in his role . in fact , he and nicholas hoult ( who played the young boy ) made the movie . if you're in the mood for a nice story , some good humor , and excellent acting , check out about a boy .
positive	suprisingly funny movie !
positive	well , i saw all of it except the last 15 minutes of it because they called us out because a tornado was heading our way . needless to say , what i saw of it , it was very good . the graphics are incredible .
negative	i fell asleep halfway through this crap . it and the exorcist are the 2 least scary movies i have seen .
positive	how can you not like this masterpiece ? i have seen it dozens of times . i never get bored of it . if you haven't seen this epic , i advise you do . brilliant ! ! !
negative	i will say this once . . i hate helen hunt !
positive	the bourne supremacy was my favorite movie of 2004 . the bourne identity was a great movie , and there was a lot of hype for the bourne supremacy , and i think the sequel lived up to and probably even surpassed the first . i'm already looking forward to the bourne ultimatum which is scheduled to be made in the next few years .
positive	i think it was a really clever action movie ( compared to xxx , which was good but not clever : ) the only funny part was the bike chase scene , a bit average , but overall a fantastic movie . i highly enjoyed it !
positive	this movie is kick ass ! it has everything . it has a great story , great directing , great acting , great action , great dialogue . its a wonderfully made epic movie . definately one of the best movies of 2000 !
negative	is 'superbabies : baby geniuses 2' stupid ? yes ! perhaps the stupidest film to come out in a long time , the idiots who gave the go to make a sequel out of the originally lame 'baby genuises' ought to be tarred and feathered for wasting millions of dollars on such worthlessness . this movie , like its predecessor , has no humor- nor does it have any real meaning to it . this movie , in short , is a disgrace almost as bad as the total failure of moviedom from years back : 'the jerky boys movie' . perhaps the only positive thing about this movie is that it can't possibly be as bad as 'the jerky boys movie' . but it comes fairly close .
positive	this movie was very good because it was like a mystery . it made you want to watch it over and over again . great acting .
negative	uninteresting , unfunny , and unwatchable movie .
positive	i love these movies . gibson and glover are perfectly paired . alot of action with a little humor makes them fun to watch
positive	probably the most intelligent flick out this summer . some funny lines , an old fashioned grown up version of lethal weapon
positive	zombies that actually moved ! creative , great shots of the game , very unique and original .
negative	adam sandler really goes over the top , sending a message to the audience of careless child care . it runs really slow at times .
positive	this film is amazing . how can you go wrong with hepburn and stewart ? !
negative	most overrated movie of all time . it's not just that it's not scary , but it's not a good movie .
positive	the best horror series ever made !
positive	my friend and fellow reviewer , the marquis ( who loved this movie so much he borrowed the name ) asked me to go along with him to see this movie . i hadn't heard much of it except for it's sexual brutality . needless to say within 5 minutes i was totally engrossed in the film . take a brilliant performance by geoffrey rush , add in michael caine and along with a great story ( although fictionalized somewhat ) and you've got an oscar-deserving movie . the review by the marquis was a bit harsh on the joaquin phoenix , but accent aside he also puts on a great performance-not quite the caliber of rush and caine but everyone needs to start somewhere . this film is not for everyone but if you want to laugh and yet be shocked by the way this movie displays hypocrisy then go and enjoy this film .
positive	i think the reason i love the movie so much is because of the characters in the movie . they are all so beautifully written , and you really feel like you get to know each of the principal characters in the movie . scarlett in my opinion is one the most complex characters ever written . she starts out as a silly teenager who only cares about herself , boys and parties , ( like most teenage girls ) . then because of the tragedies and hardships she has to grow up and become this very mature woman capable of taking care of not only herself , but her entire family . the acting in this movie is perfect , each actor / actress really embrasses their character . vivian leigh especially . in my own opinion this is by far the best ensemble cast of any movie .
positive	sir , you have 19 . . . . . . . . . hit me , i like to live dangerously . . . . 21 . . . . . . . . . i'll stay . . . . . . . . sir you have 5 . . . . . . . . i also like to live dangerously
negative	this was the lamest imax movie i have every seen . it is in 3d , so you must wear these big glasses on your head that hundreds of people before you have sweated in .
positive	an all time classic emotional roller coaster !
positive	the enduring classic tale of the cute little elephant who grows up in the circus , is ridiculed for his huge ears , then learns to fly . the product ( even in wartime ) of a seemingly more innocent age , it's lost none of its charm , should continue to delight generations to come . the baby mine sequence , when dumbo's mother gently cradles him through the bars of the cage in which she's imprisoned , must surely bring a lump to the throat of the most hardened cynic . for me , the most endearing , lovely jewel in the disney crown .
positive	wallace and gromit are , without a doubt , the two most charming , lovable , heart-warming and sweet-natured characters to ever grace both television and the silver screen . " the curse of the were-rabbit " is outrageously funny and quite simply , hilarious without being insulting . nick park is a genius ; this movie is a labor of love and the best one i have ever seen . w & g are not just for kids . some of the adults who are head over heels in love with this dynamic duo are the most worldly , sophisticated , accomplished and even cynical people i know . wallace's big , goofy grin and gromit's deep , soul eyes have captured hearts from all age groups and all walks of life . i'd give it six stars it they were available ! : )
positive	unless you're a waiting for guffman fan or a spinal tap fan ( both is even better ) , or at least seen these two films , i honestly don't believe you should see best in show . the incredible christopher guest is amazing in all three , and the fact that for guffman and this they only had about 10 pages of script is phenomenal . the improvisational skills of this cast is unbelieveable .
negative	when i watched this so called halloween ilm i was thinking to my self where in the name of god is michael myeres this movie had a verry stupid plot to it to an irish maniac wants to kill kids i mean come you are way better of watching the first two then watching this really stupid crap that is soooooooo anoying .
positive	this was a moving and heartwarming story about brotherhood , family , loyalty and love . i enjoyed watching it , and it made me want to go home and give my parents a big hug .
negative	hopeless ! this movie you would think is going to be great because of harrison ford , but it is a shocker that just drags on and on . i walked out of this movie , and i've never walked out of a movie in my life . it has a good idea , but it doesn't reach a climax or leave you on the edge of your seat . a hopeless , slow movie that isn't worth watching even if someone paid you . avoid at all costs ! !
positive	i really like jaws because i like when the shark eats people up . i feel that the people are really stupid and don't think .
positive	never seen anything like it ! sir robin ran away away ! did not !
positive	the prototypical horror film . it has it all- bone chilling music , a dark , spooky atmosphere , a good plot , and the scariest guy to ever put on a captain kirk mask in michael myers . his stealth , silence , and creative ways he caught his victims made halloween the most suspensefu ; and scary movie to date .
positive	you need to watch the directors cut to understand this brilliant film . the dream scene with the unicorn is so important , and the i , ve seen things you people wouldn , t believe speach so beautiful . a truly wonderful film brilliantly directed .
positive	one of my favorite movies . truly romantic in the larger sense of the word . beautifully written , filmed and directed .
positive	awesome ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i watch it every weekend . it never gets old . the cars are awesome , the music is awesome , and one more thing you cool man ( like how ) ok
positive	simply wonderful , gets better every decade !
positive	too funny to talk about . just watch it .
negative	i so wish there was a rating below one star . my kind husband brought this movie home to me after i mentioned i would like to see it . i was looking forward to snuggling in early and watching some of my favorite actors and actresses . i was also looking forward to laughing a great deal . suffice it to say the movie was a complete joke , one that was not funny in the least , however . i have no idea who talked these skilled actors into participating in this movie , but they should have given their salaries back to pay the production company to burn the film . it's not worth renting , trust me .
positive	a great , great sci-fi movie . how cool was schwarzenegger as the unstoppable killer robot from the future ? i remember reading somewhere that arnold was offered the role of either the hero or the villan in this movie , and , against the advice of his friends and managers , he decided to be the villan . turns out it was the smartest move he could have made . schwarzenegger's acting is so terrible that he plays a semi-human robot to perfection .
negative	i'm not sure why , but all the next generation movies just sucked . i liked every one of the old movies , and star trek : next generation was cool , the generations movie was good , but starting with first contact and voyager , star trek just started to suck .
negative	whis is the most stupidest movie ever the things are so fake freddy krueger oew makes me want to hurl the movies nasty and terrible who could watch such a devil movie
positive	everyone should own a copy of this movie . i have seen jaws 143 times , so far . the music is awesome . love this movie , hate the beach .
negative	early on , i realized that the title , among so many other things about this movie , was meant to be sarcastic . it's obvious from the opening scene that there is not going to be anything even remotely related to the word beauty involved . in fact , had its creators been looking for a more descriptive straightforward title they could easily have come up with the ugly american . after the initial shot of ugly , my brain , conditioned for such occasions long ago in the 60's and 70's , starts telling me that i will now have to switch into the late 90's , hip , nihilistic , black comedy mode . then i remember , whoops ! i think my warranty on this mode ran out sometime during the 80's ! the result is that now , when i'm faced with this brand of tripe i find it harder and harder to forgive the movie makers for several things . number one , i can't forgive them for insulting my intelligence crud is crud even when it wins three or more oscars . number two ; i can't forgive them for taking my money in exchange for this crud even if i did wait to see it at a cheap seats theater . number three - and this is the big one - i cannot forgive them for their basic statement that because they have found yet another artistic witty , and original way to present crud and , in the process , also managed to convince a panel of lost souls that they deserved national recognition for it , that we should all grow up and thank our lucky stars that these forward thinking artists have given us something with which to be entertained , educated and dog-gone-it , perhaps shed yet another layer of that pesky morality thing that seems to keep popping up as it continues to die . in other words , if you're really with the times you will genuflect to the golden statue as you swallow this crud regardless of the fact that it stinks on ice . pardon me while i get my gag reflexes under control . unable to ever switch into the proper mode , it was easy for me to see the direction and ultimate destination of american beauty . it starts out ugly , moves quickly into even uglier and ends with a violent , crashing , ugly grand finale which makes war of the roses ( michael douglas , kathleen turner ) seem like a little , domestic squabble . since viewers are treated to generous portions of perversion , violence , psychotic behavior , irritating teenage angst , pathetic mid-life crises , and a three-layer selection of dysfunctional families , there is a little ugliness for every age group and personal taste ( or distaste ) . add to this the fact that not one character in the entire film has even one redeeming characteristic or the ability to elicit the slightest bit of sympathy and you have yet another great reason to not go to the movie theater .
negative	t3 was a joke . did they writers even watch the first two movies ? ? they butchered the storyline , and ruined the trilogy . the previous movies were serious , with some comedy . . . this was a comedy with bad graphics . graphics are suppose to make things look more real , not totally abstract . ( see t2 idiots ) i think t2 graphics were much better . . . . and the sound . . . . bad sound . . . . what happened to no fate but what we make . . . . the future isn't written ? ? ? ? then why the hell does j conner have a solemate . what a joke . this isn't another stupid chosen one movie , where the he is destined to glory , he just happens to be the one who saves the day in the end . he isn't a jesus figure . . . . writters took stuff from the matrix storyline and thrusted it into a much more complex story . t1 and t2 had a story , a good story , with significant action scenes and a plot . yes , plot . the amount of crap that was shoved into t3 complicated the movie , i don't even know exactly what happened . people don't need none stop action , t2 fans liked the story , not just effects . and , the effects were actually good , not a joke . i still don't know how skynet was built despite the work of dyson in short , t3 was a comedy , with no story , no acting , no sound , and no legitimate connection to the previous movies . i have so much respect for james cameron that i never knew .
positive	fantastic film ! an absolute must see movie ! this film is very heavily into symbolic imagery . speaking about his film , the director referred to it by saying that some directors share an lsd trip that they share with the audience but this film is an lsd pill that let's each viewer have their own unique trip !
positive	good documentary with the real shane , love the pogues , opened my eyes a little , he was crazier than i thought . . got to be a 5 . . . . . . . . . .
positive	the very first movie i saw in a theater . still great . light hearted , good hearted , moving , spectacular entertainment . quite funny in spots . to bad chris reeve is dead . that sucks .
positive	this is a throwback to the 50s and 60s . one can almost imagine humphrey bogart in this . bryan singer did an excellant job with this movie . one of my all time favorites this should have taken the oscar for best picture . twisting and turning constantly this is a movie that gets better with repeated viewings .
positive	outstanding film . it gives an amazing portrayal of war and tom hanks deserves an oscar for it . it's about time wwii veterans were remembered in an incredible film like this .
positive	the most powerful giant monster movie of all time .
positive	great film , really creepy and scary .
positive	babs is good all of the time . she is a perfectionist and it shows . always , always delivers a fabulous performance . there are few like her . i miss seeing her .
positive	john belushi and dan ackroyd star as ex-felons on a mission from god to raise money to save an orphanage . they set out to gather the members of their ( musical ) band and throw a concert to raise the money . with musical cameos by aretha franklin , stevie wonder and others , a comparable movie would be impossible to make today . any fan of blues music needs to watch this movie .
negative	how anyone could give this more than two stars is beyond me . starring the only actor less funny and talented than adam sandler .
negative	i want 90 minutes of my life back . . .
positive	out of all the jim carrey movies i've seen , this is the best ! it's so real . . .
positive	now this is comedy ! !
negative	could that movie have been just a little longer ? i wasn't bored quite long enough .
negative	bad movie . honestly the only person in this film , no , movie who was believable or likable for that matter was francis mcdormand . what do you expect ? she steals every movie shes in . not for one second did i believethese guys were rock stars . this is an extrememly watered down pasturized version of rock and roll so it can reach a broader audience and not offend anyone . there is nothing rock and roll about this film . you do hear elton john , but we all know that doesnt count . i changed my rating from a two to a one because the hype for this terrible movie makes me ill .
positive	speed is the greatest movie because keanu reeves is the star . sandra bullock is good to except when she kisses keanu . anyway , i loved this movie because of the buildup of tension and excitement . i also like how the villan dies at the end . blood , guts , decapitation and more blood ; makes a great movie in my book . oh , and the bus rescue / blow up scene was the best . lots of action , but the love bit between keanu and sandra was a bit much .
positive	this has to be one of my favorite movie .
positive	very funny , lemmon , curtis and monroe is superb form . monroe is beautiful and ditzy , lemmon is hysterical as daphne with curtis as josephine ! brilliant writing and direction combine beautifully to make this a comedy classic .
positive	mel gibson puts on an inspiring performance as william wallace . the battle scenes in this movie are the most amazing scenes ever . inspiring speeches and acts of selflessness highlight the overriding theme of freedom .
positive	still the best of all the terminators . yeah the effects look really dated but they are still effective and arnold is an awesome special effect all by himself . the story moves along better than the other two and unlike in t2 there is no heavy handed message bogging the movie down .
positive	one of the best bill murray is a good actor and harold ramis is a good director
positive	c'mon . . . who wouldn't love to explore a world made of candy ?
negative	i hate this movie . can someone say boring ? this is the most boring movie i ever watched . i got a fat headache from the camera's movements . talk about a waste of seven bucks .
negative	brittany murphy sucks .
positive	i want my $ 2 !
positive	it's been rather difficult of late doing without any bruce willis die hard movies . realizing of course how john mcclain is pretty much worn out . . . ca-poots-kah . . ! but who can blame the dude , after all those disgusting messes those grueber dudes put him through . ya know what i'm sayin ? those guys had john climbin up elevator shafts and shootin at him then blowin things up all around john . . . and terrible stuff like that . oh well , thanks for the memorys john mcclain you were a shining example of courage in the nypd . . . fer sure dude . perhaps now that john's pretty much exhausted his role as super ny cop . . . well , maybe john can get on as a rent a cop with some late night warehouse in the east side of ny . best movies ever ; those die hard series . yep , no doubt about it . . . fer sure . john was the best .
negative	three words ( plus an article ) : crude , rude and lewd .
positive	not mean to be a documentary , the pianist follows the story of a warsaw survivor . excellent , excellent , excellent . brody works magic on the screen .
positive	i have long been a fan of monty python , and currently own all of their feature films and several episodes of the old tv show . life of brian was amazingly scripted , with just enough biblical references to make it seem historical , yet blasphemous enough to be funny and incredibly insulting to religious people .
positive	i would recommend this movie during halloween . this movie , when it first arrived at the theaters , frightened me , because this was considered to be the future .
negative	heh , amazing . . . ly stupid . dont see this movie . you watch it for an hour and a half uninterested and you see the ending and want to commit suicide becuase it doesnt make any sense at all . dont see this movie .
positive	another great movie . i really like these kind of movies , the mafioso movies . i like how they showed very little detail of his life , how he became one of the goodfellas , and how he got out . plus , it's a real story .
negative	this movie was a waste of $ 8 . 25 2 hours .
positive	an excellent drama about the notorious female serial killer aileen wuonos . charlize theron did an excellent jon as the evil female serial killer and christina ricci did another excellent job as wuonos's lesbian lover . wuonos killed seven men in florida in 1990 and she rightfully got the death penalty . she was executed in 2002 .
positive	irvin welsh is so crazy . he wrote trainspotting and other crazy books . he has a lot of great short stories . trainspotting makes more and more sense the more you watch it . it is a crazy weird movie though .
negative	i couldn't stand watching this one , my girlfriend and i turned it off after a half hour . i didn't find it clever at all . if i want to watch a film about crooks , i'll watch goodfellas , casino , usual suspects , reservior dogs , etc . this one falls flat on it's face .
positive	most movies tom hanks is in are great . this was outstanding . possibly not so much for his acting , per se , but the reality of the movie . it pretty much showed what would happen if someone was stranded on a deserted island . gilligan's island it wasn't . i enjoyed the movie and the realism portrayed . i can also see how even a volley ball could become one's best friend in such a situation . ( i'll bet the wilson company paid a lot for that one , eh ? not quite as much as fed ex did though )
positive	all conspiracy flicks have to give stylish , plausible , unexpected answers to forgotten everyday paradoxes and mysteries . men in black did all that and a bag of chips . funny , smart , perfectly cast , even touching ( though a bit icky-gross ) , this is more of a comedy of buddy cops than a star-trek type of sci-fi flick . i laughed so hard an alien came out of my chest .
positive	i like orlando oops i forgot his last name he plays leggouses don't know how to spell that thogh
positive	fantastic movie ! ! ! ! the storyline is very simple and is very lifelike ! it is about a boy that questions life . it is an honest portrayal of a young boy ! it makes you think ! one of the best movies i have seen in a long time !
positive	can you say excellent ? this movie was so hilarious . a definate classic in the arena of comedy movies . jason lee and shannen doughtery were wonderful in this movie . kevin smith is just totally awesome .
positive	wonderful movie ! gives a very good insight about indians living abroad and of course all in a very comic way . not boring at all . hope to see more such movies in future .
positive	the best evil dead to date
positive	it's hard not to think of russell crowe's holier than thou attitude but he really shined in this movie . it almost rates up there with ben hur as a period flick but that chariot race can never be beat .
positive	one of 5 movies i could watch everyday and still laugh . lots of dialogue that we used when we were in high school . funny just because of its dialogue , sexual innuendos for people who just love the perverted comedy . mike myers is just great all around .
positive	this would have to be my favourate star trek tng movies . the music , especially when picard was entering into the nexus was beautiful , and i would love to go into this nexus where all my desires were fulfilled ! that movie reminded me of heaven ( the nexus ) a bit . plus the story line was good . the meeting between picard and kirk was interesting . at least kirk could defeat soren which was good !
negative	don't even bother watching this piece of crap . watch the trailer instead it reveals the entire plot . you'll save a couple hours of your life .
positive	shrek is a great movie . it will have you laughing till you cry . eddie murphy as donkey is hilarious ! ! ! he does a great job ! ! !
negative	oh my god . this piece of crud was the most overhyped and overated thing i ever seen . renee zellwegger needs to leave the singing business . the music score was terrible . catherine zeta jones can not dance or sing at all . she needs to stick to speaking roles . as for queen latifah , she was well in her role , but she's the only good thing that happened to this movie . seriously , none of the characters are likable . roxie heart is as pretty as a donkey's vas deferens and as talented at singing as a screeching bat .
positive	one of my favorite movies . glory is the story of robert gould shaw - the white commander of one of the first battallions of black soldiers in the civil war . the book which the movie was based upon was written by piecing together letters which shaw sent back to his new england family - and which are still on display in a boston museum . the acting is superb - morgan freeman , denzel washington , matthew broderick , the story is compelling ( and true ) , and the drama is intense . if you have not seen this movie , brace yourself - it is sad and powerful and deep and historical .
positive	incredibly funny movie , with a spectrum of humor from lowbrow slapstick to witty parody . the i speak jive , i like my coffee black like my men , kareem abdul jabbar , and the crazy dude in the control tower are just a few of many gems of priceless comedy . for continuous laughs , few movies trump airplane .
positive	this is the scariest movie , chucky is the scariest actor . i can't believe it . there should have been more stuff than there is .
positive	great movie , a must see .
positive	great flick . strong character development , good plot and excellent acting .
positive	a great movie to watch . although the 2nd was a bigger hit , i still think this movie set a very good stage .
positive	in this very well written and acted movie , you get emotionally drawn into the script . each moment of horror has meaning other than just for increasing the body count . the movie has enough twists and turns to keep you entertained , and just when you think you have it figured out , there's more than meets the eye . . . literally .
positive	the birds is an extremly chilling and scary movie that stars supermodel of the 60's , tippi hedren . the film is pretty bloody for it's time , and it is pretty graphic , but i would want my kids to see it , because i want them to get used to watching these good movies .
positive	why isn't there a 100000 in this ratinnnnggg ? ? ? ? ? ! ! !
negative	that movie was so boring ! there was only one scary part in the whole film . the part when the alien thingy walked out from behind the bushes . i laughed at most of it like the part where they had tin foil on their heads .
positive	a classic . the use of colors is especially inspired . a more warped and decadent view of society is hard to come by .
positive	ok , i admit it , i'm a sap . i loved this movie . definitely one of my favorites . for those of you who prefer garbage like closer - go for it ! however , i think this movie is closer to reality than that piece of trash . this was a true love story and what true love is all about . we can learn a lot from the love shared by noah and allie . i don't understand why people find depressing , gross movies so interesting and stimulating while dissing a beautiful , positive movie like this one . perhaps it is the fate of humanity to wallow in sludge . me ? i prefer to roll in beauty , and this movie is beautiful . well-scripted , well-acted - james garner was superb and ryan gosling was hot ! rachel mcadams came out of nowhere and i hope to see her in more movies in the future . a lovely cast and a story that leaves you feeling like there is hope for the human race , where's the downside ? for those of you who think this is too pat , they indicate that it wasn't a perfect marriage , but it took work and commitment . i have been married for 26 years to the love of my life and not only am i glad i hung in there with us , but i can't imagine my world without him . no , it wasn't easy and we almost divorced twice , but we hung in there and worked hard . like noah and allie , i hope not to have to face life without the love of my life . this movie was not about fantasy - it was about hope and commitment and the joy one can have in marriage when two work hard and love much . a stunning movie ! i haven't yet met a person in real life who hasn't liked this movie ( my husband was annoyed that it made him cry , but other than that , it's been a 100 % hit ) . i also loved the interweaving of their young love story with the end of their lives love story . what a wonderful , positive movie . i agree with winter spirit to beware of the love scenes . while i disagree it was a good portion of the film , it's not a good idea to let young children watch this movie . probably should have been rated r . but , for once , i didn't think it was gratuitous sex as in most movies ( see closer ) , it was the culmination and outward manifestation of the tremendous love shared by these two characters . i prefer to believe that humanity is capable of positive love and happy marriages . learn from this movie how to do it ! beware : bring your hankies : )
positive	a great contemporary film . well-written , acted , and directed .
negative	horrid and painful remake of the classic 1950's horror flick . not even worth reviewing .
positive	i love the seagulls . mine , mine , mine ! ! ! lol
positive	lol second best movie of jim carrey hahahaha
negative	one word terrible . first , i don't much care for most snipes flicks . they tend to all be about the same , and always predictable , and he always plays the same character . there are a few that are ok , but this isn't one of them . the special effects were bad , and one could tell that the budget was all spent on snipes because the cars that blew up were always old cars off by themselves where the shots were easy to control . avoid this film if you can .
positive	brad pitt and edward norton shine in this cutting edge drama . the whole movie is thrilling and humerous . i was on the edge of my seat ( couch ) the whole entire movie . wow ! ! ! one of my favorite films of all time . no doubt about it .
positive	i love the way she looks in this movie . i only wish that i had an interesting life like hers .
negative	this movie isn't funny , not a bad movie for the period , not funny though !
negative	total waste of money ! her only good movie was chicago , and i didnt even like that movie b / c of her !
positive	great 3-d movie filled with symbolism and intrigue not normally found in an imax film . wonderful experience .
positive	great movie , i liked how they incorporated christian concepts into the movie with out preaching .
negative	crapola . a shameless rip off of duel , the hitcher and just about every other manipulative horror flick of the '90s ( even though this came out in 2001 ) . roger ebert gave it four stars . was he on crack ?
positive	great film with a great cast . an extremely stark and realistic view on crime . harvey keitel , michael madsen and tim roth are awesome ! very original story and format . tarantino is a genius .
positive	this is one of the most amazing movies of our ( some of our ) childhoods ! it show a beautiful portrayal of four innocent boys . the acting is outstanding for these children . they were all around the age of twelve . they all had the lines memorized . this is a feel good movie that sure will get to you in that good way . you feel good for watching it . i just wish movies these days could have such substance . oh well .
negative	one of the sleazest movies i have seen . i kept waiting for something good to happen . i found myself being very disappointed . this movie about a guy who gets into pornography one of the crummiest movies i have seen .
positive	like i've been saying since i saw it , this is the second best movie i've seen all year -- teetering on being the first . funny from start to finish , and i literally had goosebumps at how cool ( action-wise ) this movie was . great buddy action-comedy , and dare i say it beat rush hour at the genre rush hour helped to create and make popular ? i really hope this one helps to launch the rock's career as an action star and people start to take him seriously because of the role . he did a superb job , yet people laugh and can't believe it when i say it if they haven't seen the movie .
positive	i have just been to see miss congeniality and i was surprised at the amount of people that came to see the show , i personnely found it funny and it was great to see some old faces in the movie . michael cain and others . i also liked the fact that if you brought your children they would enjoy it too and they would find some of the parts really funny .
positive	eddie murphy ! what more is there to say ? ?
positive	i think toy story was really well done and silly . when i went to see the sequel in the theater , there wasn't one little kid in the audience . nope , it was all teenagers !
positive	wonderful thought provoking film and [ thankfully ] no-one being blown up , chased . . . . not much action but much emotion
positive	this was a spectactular movie and the cast was amazing . even though it is over three hours long , i couldn't stop watching it . it has such a magical tone to it . and the music is almost eerie . the cast gave an unbelievable performance . doug hutchinson was amazing as percy , the little a * * hole , and by the end of the movie you just had the urge to strangle him . tom hanks , as always , gives an astounding performance as paul edgecombe . bonnie hunt was very good , too , as paul's wife . david morse was great and i give him two thumbs up for pushing percy around and nearly beating the crap out of him . sam rockwell was so hilarious as wild bill . barry pepper as the young gaurd on e block . michael jeter as the inmate who befriends a mouse . and , of course , michael clarke duncan as john coffey , accused of murder , but can give life with the touch of his hands . i loved this movie . the good and the evil in these men of e block was brought out in a marvelous way . if you loved the movie , read the book .
positive	this was an incredible film . i-max in general produces many of the best film releases . this is a perfect movie for any jordan fanatic as well as any sports fans . the camera angles provide a great format to view michael jordans unimitatable moves .
positive	another stanley kubrick masterwork . i could watch it every week and never get tired of it . the overlook hotel is the most menacing horror film set--no question .
positive	enjoyed it so much i bought the dvd . it's a keeper .
positive	this is the film to watch in a dark movie house , it scared the hell out of me . . . if this does'nt scare you nothing will !
positive	it's probably one of the only musicals i actually like . it stars johnny depp as a very angry self-confessed juvenile delinquent with his friends milton , wanda , and milton's girlfriend hatchet-face . then they befriend an uptight prudish girl named allison vernon williams ( amy locane ) . their lifestyles collide and lots of hysteria and chaos unravels .
positive	great movie ! ! !
positive	great movie ! ! !
negative	sucked , an insult to those real vets . precision bombing in world war ii ? please , those planes dumped their bombs and ran , people below be damned .
positive	this was definitely one of the best movies i've seen in a long time . the time just flew by . i can't wait to see it again and will definitely buy the dvd as soon as it comes out .
positive	the coen brothers did it again . another great movie . the same sort of twisted humor is involved in this as in previous movies , yet it is much different . this movie will keep you locked in the whole time .
positive	how can this be anything less than a 5 ?
negative	my opinion is that if walt disney had actually been frozen and he was brought back to life , he would see the dumb movies his company has made over the last few years and he would have a heart attack and die- again .
positive	here we have david lean again . this movie goes on too long but it has everything you need--romance , heartbreak , nobility , betrayal , action etc . pasternak's work is well done . i didn't like omar sharif in the title role in the 1960's but he has grown on me over the decades and i am satisfied in his role as the doc . the characters are too english however , but so what , i guess .
positive	i've only seen a few katharine hepburn films and this by far is my favorite ! she is so much fun and she moves quickly from scene to scene it never gets dull . cary grant is also great . his forte was totally the screwball comedy .
negative	silly not scary
negative	uh-uh . not scary .
negative	what a joke ! ! ! you guys should really get your facts straight and don't trust a puppet that's funded by hollywood . his documentary is riddled with more holes than a slab of swiss cheese . first of all he used an excerpt from a bush speech and claimed it was regarding the iraq war . in reality he was talking about the israelis and the palistinians . he claims that bush invited the taliban to texas for a visit . wrong , a texas oil company that had nothing to do with bush invited him . what he failed to mention was the fact that mr . bill clinton actually did invite the taliban to visit this country ! nice try michael moron . . . please do yourself a favor and check the facts out before believing any of his propaganda .
negative	it's a waste of money . i thought it was gonna be good cause of the famous voices for the animals boy was i wrong , the audience only laughed once and it wasn't a fall of the chair laugh just a simple ha ha . i warned ya .
negative	definitely a film you either love or hate . it did not appeal to me . the storyline is unfocused . the main character is full of himself and not relatable . the special effects are laughable .
positive	way underrated as a movie , maybe a little too cerebral for a comic book movie .
positive	with the release of quills , the film version of doug wright's play about the final days of the infamous marquis desade , with a script by the playwright himself , we are reminded what power the medium has the potential to command . the film presents a largely fictionalized account of the last days of the marquis desade ( geoffrey rush ) , confined to the charenton institution for the insane . through his interactions with a young laundress , madeleine ( kate winslett ) , an initially idealistic young priest , abbe de coulmier ( joaquin phoenix ) and the cruel , authoritarian dr . royer-collard ( michael caine ) , the author explores issues of censorship , religion and hypocrisy ( why do those three subjects complement each other so well ? ) . the film , while lacking the visceral immediacy of the play , has an inherent realism and intimacy that compensates for any losses . the attention to detail is exquisite , from the clothing to the closeups revealing stained , unpleasant teeth . the performances are superb , particularly those of oscar winners caine and rush . joaquin phoenix is by far the weakest link , attempting an annoying approximation of an english accent , presumably in order to sound like the rest of the cast , though since the film is set in france , the reasoning here becomes convoluted . however , phoenix's relative weaknesses are more than compensated for . this film is not for everyone . it is uncompromisingly grim . grimmer , even , than the historical fact of it's subject matter . those looking for romance , in any conventional sense , and a happy ending will be disappointed on both counts . however , the film does reward by delivering uncompromising energy and unremitting intensity for those who choose to approach it seriously .
negative	i love john travolta but this movie was a wasted hour of my time . it had great music but no story .
positive	one of the all time greats ! michael caine and sean connery . john huston adapted the story into a feature film starring sean connery as daniel dravot , michael caine as peachey carnehan , and christopher plummer as rudyard kipling . now what could be better in an old fashioned adventure yarn ? while at the offices of the northern star newspaper , rudyard kipling is approached by a ragged , seemingly crazed derelict , who reveals himself to be his old acquaintance peachy carnahan . peachy tells kipling the story of how he and his cohort danny dravot traveled to remote kafiristan , become gods , and ultimately lose everything . after meeting kipling at his newspaper office a few years earlier and signing a contract pledging mutual loyalty , carnahan and dravot muster an army from the natives of a kafiristan village . in their first battle , the natives decide that daniel is a god after he is shot with an arrow in the chest but continues fighting . in fact , the arrow has struck a bandolier beneath his clothing and become lodged in it , but the natives don't know this . when they arrive in the holy city of sikandergul , the natives confuse their masonic medals for symbols of alexander the great and declare the men to be gods . danny has delusions of grandeur , while peachy wants to sneak out of the city with chests of gold and jewels . danny decides to take a wife from amongst the natives , much against peachy's advice ; he chooses roxanna ( played by michael caine's real-life wife shakira ) . roxanna fears no woman can live if they consort with a god , and so tries to escape from daniel , biting him in the process . the bite draws blood , and when the natives see it they realise daniel is human after all , and pursue him and peachy through the streets of his erstwhile kingdom . danny is killed when forced to walk to the middle of a rope bridge over a deep canyon ; the ropes supporting it are cut and he falls to his death . peachy is tortured and released . at the end of the film , as peachy finishes his story , he presents kipling with danny's decaying head , still wearing its kafiri crown .
positive	i was on the edge of my seat great movie
positive	i don't know why . . but i like this movie . : )
positive	great story , great moments . what could be better ?
positive	a wonderfully thoughful movie , it takes an unlikely duo in a foreign place and strikes the human chord of the search for meaning and fulfillment . bill murray and scarlett johannson are phenomenal , their mastery of their roles was amazing especially when there wasn't dialogue . an extremely poignant , artful film . sofia coppola is such a fantastic talent ! she treats films like paintings , delicate and emotional . i can't wait for her next project .
positive	hell yeah ! this movie was soo good ! i thought everyone that played in it looked and acted good . it was like jumpy , funny , action like all at the same time . nicholas cage is sooo hot in the movie !
positive	walt disney's crowining glory in animation . a unique , brilliant style , oscar-nominated music , delightful characters--- sleeping beauty has it all .
negative	no comment . . .
positive	this was the cohn bros funniest movie , next to raising arizona .
positive	leave behind any misconceptions about indian cinema ; this wonderful satyajit ray film ( the first of the famous apu trilogy ) about a young boy and his poor family in bengal is far removed from the gaudy extravagant melodramatic bollywood musicals , and is undoubtedly one of the crowning achievements of world cinema . winner of the 1955 cannes festival , it's gently engaging , beautifully observant of nature , imbued with a child's sense of wonderment , as well as deeply lyrical , wise and poetic . recommended unreservedly , to anyone who prefers contemplative pleasures to breakneck action .
positive	great movie . action packed . no dragging . good storyline . a movie for people interested in military and science fiction .
positive	i loved peter pan ! i saw it 2 or three times
negative	more like stupid babies : baby geniuses 2 . how did this movie get the greenlight ?
negative	i only saw 'speed 2 : cruise control' once . never have i been more disappointed at a sequel . reviewer harold-insane said it right : what happened ? well , i have three words to describe it : this blows chunks !
positive	five stars all the way ! wayne and garth offer a great look into the mind of the hard rocking youth of 80's america . garth was my hero when i was younger . this movie is a great blend of comedy and even a little drama . well , maybe not . whoever thinks that kids from suburbia are boring . you're wrong ! this movie is excellent ! sha .
positive	fun to watch , and more in-depth and story-based than a lot of other sci-fi flicks . a solid classic .
negative	this movie gave me vivid nightmares for a week . it had no plot , just gore and blood and psychopaths . i saw the movie almost two years ago and i still get goosebumps when i think about it .
negative	i just don't get it .
positive	this is good science fiction outside the modern slash and splatter mode . this has a plot and a story . charlton heston is great here .
positive	i still can't sleep well at night .
positive	hysterical and original ! i can watch it again and again and never get bored !
positive	this was the only astroid movie that came out worth watching . very intense .
positive	great film ! i can watch it over and over . all the acting is great ; kevin spacey is awesome . one of my top five all time favorites .
positive	this is definately one of the best movies of all time
positive	this is an awesome , incredible movie ! ! one of the best out , and one of my favorites ! ! the story is almost too powerful for its own good , as the slightly emotional among us probably had trouble staying dry-eyed through parts . but , it never got overly sappy at all - never pathetic . just a great , warm , incredible movie . patch adams , the man , has become one of my true to life heros .
positive	this has become my favorite movie of all time . i can watch it over and over and never get tired of it . can't wait for the sequels . jim
positive	this is the best movie ever made . it has all the elements of life : love , family , loyalty , betrayal . . .
positive	very sweet movie predictable but nice and a blend of a fairytail and a comedy mostly comedy .
negative	overdramatic , dark , boring and laced with useless profanities , this r-rated terror of the night needs to learn some lessons from other dramatic franchises such as star trek .
positive	definitely worth seeing . finally , a " family " flick that doesn't put me to sleep . like lotr , it took a long time before film technology could do justice to it . it's a very imaginative story tht allows people to choose how much symbolism is involved . supposedly , author c . s . lewis based the hero ( a lion ) on a certain figure prominently featured in the new testament . the acting was decent . i loved tilda swinton in " the deep end . " she plays a very beyotchee witch with perpetual bad hair days , which seems to put her in a murderous rage all the time . she does a decent job with her swordplay -- even with her skinny little arms . as i always say , the mark of a great actress is her ability to wield swords or to launch kicks . take julia roberts or jennifer aniston , overated damsels ; the only thing tough they can do is pout while smoking a cigarette .
positive	this was about the funniest movie i've ever seen . every scene was funny . intricate plot , clever dialogue , excellent acting , great cinematography and well written . this deserves to be much higher on the list , my guess is that it's new and many people haven't yet seen it . highly recommended !
positive	the 15 minute journey into hell that was featured as the american forces stormed the beach at normandy was perhaps the most riviting and horrifyingly true to life cinema that has ever been created . the audience is right in there amongst the carnage as bodies are being torn apart and young lives are lost in the most unnatural ways . i don't see any politics being played out here , just stark , naked reality . although the actual occurrences of dday outstripped these terrible scenes a thousandfold , from the accounts of surviving soldiers who were there , the film comes closer than any of it's predecessors . the story is secondary to the horrors lived out on screen and spielberg outdoes himself as a director of visuals . the progression of this great director's career has been amazing . as his budgets rise , his films seem to grow exponentially .
positive	if somebody woulda hired some marines to take care of that little a hole bruce willis instead of stupid forigners he wouldnt be so hard to die ! i wish bruce willis was my father
positive	la mejor comedia-gore que v en mi vida , de lejos la mejor , insuperada . injustamente relegada por la crtica . un clsico en toda ley .
positive	my favorite comedy . almost non-stop laughs , and a nice mixture of sophisticated humor and slapstick . hope the sequel lives up to the original .
negative	ridiculously pathetic . two thumbs down .
negative	this movie is terrible because it re-does every old trick from the first movie . i was not surprised , and was insulted by their pitiful portrayal of one of the only black women in a major role of an action film in a long time .
positive	one of the great silent films of all time , and one of the best and most intelligent horror films as well . i particularly like the scene of the rats biting the sailors .
positive	you want a funny movie , go see hitch ! it was hilarious . my friend and i laughed the whole way through , as did her two aunts ! it was so funny , and wil smith cracked me up , when he was teaching the guy to dance .
positive	as a comic book fan . . . i loved it . . . and yet it had enough drama and action to draw non- fans in . and isn't that what this movie should do ? ? ? loved the geek stuff thrown in for the fans and i think it gave enough background to allow everyone to enjoy . . . . can not wait for the sequal .
positive	great movie , this is definately carpenter's best and brightest . this will be a classic for years to come .
positive	sorry , but this is one of my favorite holiday movies and it contains my favorite christmas song , white christmas . nobody sang it better than bing crosby .
positive	one of the funniest movie of all time .
negative	a maudlin and simplistic love story during which the japanese happen to bomb pearl harbour . prettily filmed though .
positive	i admit , you have to be a little twisted to like this movie , but that's the shear joy of it for fans that appreciate it . . . it's twistedness that is .
positive	this movie best describes the african american society where blacks were all segregated in one area and where chaos drives many of them to violence . true film that shows how bad things were .
negative	what an utter disappointment , there is no comparison between this tripe and the original ( which is a remake of the superior japanese version ) . the original had genuine atmosphere , inventive cinematography and real suspense . the film quality is very standard this time around and lacks the high contrast grainy quality of the first that added to the atmosphere . the main protagonist hasn't gained any more intelligence since the first movie . in fact , she is a complete ditz who needs an iq infusion to take it out of the double digits . in the first version , she had somewhat of an excuse as she stumbled across the origins of the videotape and began to realize the implications . there were indications in the first movie that she was somewhat of an absent parent who needed to make a connection with her child . in this version , she is even more absent-minded and neglectful . warning : spoilers ahead examples : 1 ) right near the beginning , the demonic girl makes an appearance by emerging from a body bag and grabbing the mother to try to pull her into the netherworld . hmmm . . . you'd think the mother would clue in and grab her kid and find a police station , hospital or some of other well-lit public place with lots of other people . nope , instead she leaves her kid alone in a big empty house while she does her investigative reporting at all hours of the night . plus , they have a big screen tv in their new digs . hello ! you would think after what they went through in the first movie , they would avoid being around tvs at all costs . it gets worse , not even half way through the movie , the mother has either left her kid alone or lost him altogether an additional 2-3 times . example 2 ) would be after seeing the demonic girl manifest herself in the kid's room and seep out of the walls , the mother takes her son to her romantic interest's house . . . and leaves him alone in the bathtub while she goes for a drive ! the demonic girl loves the water ; it's her calling card and main mode of transport , apparently . so , naturally the kid is on his own again with you-know-who . and don't get me started on the " scary " computer-animated herd of roaming deer , yeah , that's right --- demonic deer ! vicious , villainous venison ! oooo , spooky ! it has to be one of the most unintentionally funny moments in a horror film and brings the suspense to a screeching halt . no floatation device , ring or otherwise , would save this sinker .
positive	my all time favorite movie . hard core modern day mafia by genius director , quentin tarantino . how can you go wrong with a cast like that ? complex story lines are key .
positive	great ! jennefer garner shines
negative	i know this movie was made when i born and i would probably would have been scared and all but i saw it a couple of years ago and i laughed i don't see nothing scary about it .
positive	this movie was hella funny . i laughed throughout the whole movie . the wayans bros . are funny . the plot was stupid but funny . they made fun of all the scary movies and it was cool .
negative	whoopie - painful as always .
positive	this movie is just silly and i love it . peter sellers does a hilarious job in all three of his parts . this movie has some of my favorite images like dr . stragelove trying to suppress a nazi salute , the insane officer firing a belt fed machine gun at his own troops , yelling feed me ! , and of course the cowboy riding the icbm . overall , hilarious and one of my all time favorites .
negative	if i ever wanted to see such crap again id head straight to a toilet
positive	like james bond , ethan is our kind of special agent . het gets to break into facilities using interesting tools and weapons . he gets to look at confidential papers , and gets the girl . what was all bad though is his folks get shot .
positive	great movie about the teens of today . fits what we feel as teens . key situations that could have happened and how someone would have reacted . one guy in the movie just cracks me up- the jock trash talker just showing concern for himself being oblivious to everyone around .
negative	this wasn't a good war movie . some things in this movie are not true to history . in some of the battle scenes , the japanese soldiers appear to be bad soldiers . in some scenes , most of the soldiers couldn't kill the american standing right in front of them . in reality , the japanese soldiers were the some of the best trained in the entire world . i think cage is too old to play this part . he's almost 40 and he's playing a marine sergeant . he's too old for the part . if your haven't noticed from watching the movie , everything is off . the american grenades make an explosion the size of a artillery shell . the japanese soldiers are shown as having no hand to hand combat skills . terrible historical film .
negative	other than the presence of michelle pfeiffer , there is nothing at all redeeming about this cheap film .
positive	many claim beauty and the beast or snow white to be their favorite tradationally-animated disney feature . i , on the other hand , choose the emperor's new groove . certaintly able to be described as an atypical disney film , this one ditches the emotional plot and sappy music to focus on out-and-out humor . the voice cast is quite talented , but patrick warburton shines through as the enjoyably-inept krunk . with smooth animation , the feature has snappy dialogue . the best humor comes from moments where the fourth wall is shattered with style . more movies and tv shows should break the fourth wall and play with the sense of reality !
negative	question ? why do all these action movies want to have a fight sequence like the matrix ?
positive	this is the best newest film i've seen this year . . i think that anyone wh's anyone should see it if they haven't this is a good movie to show u reality ! !
positive	this movie was great because it got me jumping out of my seat with horror ! even when i could tell something bad was going to happen , i still jumped . if you like movies that scare you just enough not to cover your eyes , the sixth sense is the movie to see .
positive	i loved it so much ! ! ! i am counting down the days until the dvd comes out in december ! ! ! woo hoo , you all go out and buy it ok ? give it up for napoleon and pedro . . . i wish he was on the election ballot , i woner how many people would have voted for him ? ! haha .
positive	i love this movie . one of the best action movies ever .
positive	the funniest movie of the year . i'm a great jim carrey fan and once again he gave us laughs .
positive	i watched this movie late at night , so i was tired . the beginning was kind of slow , and i almost fell asleep . but towards the middle good action scenes kick in . combined with great technical effects , this story is heart-breaking .
positive	excellent portrayal of a mental asylum and the struggles people face if they are different . good reading , but quite depressing .
positive	this is a great movie . this one is better than the first . this is the update of the first fantasia . i found a lot of the segments interesting . like the carnival of the animals . there was only one returning segment .
positive	brett fav-ray . the final 5 minutes alone make it worth it .
positive	aaaaahhhhh ! ! ! ! !
positive	glad to see this movie rated so high . best and smartest comedy all time ! john goodman's best role ever ! donnie was a good man , and a good bowler . . . but you took him , lord , like you did to so many young men before their time at lon doc , khe sahn , and hill 354 ! ( all real vietnam battles by the way )
positive	latima duma kaizer soze ! i loved the bulletin board scene that tied everything together . verbal's scene right afterwards just makes the film ( although the telling of kazier soze is pretty damn cool too ) .
positive	a genius movie . my favorite of all time with perhaps a few disney classics as exceptions . tina fey is genius as a writer .
positive	i'm glad this movie was made . it's a slice of real life whether you like it or not . homosexuality has been around since the beginning of time--it's not going away folks . instead of constantly persecuting these people , maybe it's time to try and understand them . i think this movie is a small step in the right direction . i think all the " brokebutt " comments are so juvenile and ignorant . people need to grow-up . maybe it's time we focus on more pressing issues that are really affecting society . i really have a problem with my tax dollars being used to raise the children of people who are too stupid or lazy to practice birth control .
positive	always a pleasure to watch trading places . most all of eddie murphy's early movies were great , and this is no exception .
positive	a lot of fun , and reasonably well scripted and acted . much the best of the trilogy .
negative	despite the fact that i watched this movie on a flight from boston to sfo , this movie was so bad i still thought about walking out on it . i used to like will farrell , but now after 29 movies over three years it has become apparent how one-dimensional and unoriginal he really is . he's the same character in every movie , and most recently they have all been bad movies . nicole kidman was at least a little ( very little ) likable in the movie , but she drops in my opinion -- guilt by association . what was she thinking taking on this role ? this was one of the worst movies ever .
negative	walking into this mess .
positive	amazing !
positive	the wayans brothers have done it again with their parody on the recent horror movies to hit theaters . very similar to the style of their earlier movie , don't be a menace . . . the movie is funny from beginning to end . warning : the movie contains a lot of sexual content .
positive	who could not like any of the indiana jones films ? this role suits harrison ford down to the ground , cheeky , moody and a good sense of humour - the action scenes are great and the script is really good . great family film .
positive	do you hear that little 'bump , 'bump , 'bump ? that's where the heart is . great movie . natalie portman did a terrific job . she does a western accent wonderfully . i liked how james frain ( forney ) acted . very sentimental and good movie . sends out a good message .
positive	i love this movie cause halle berry is in it ! shes a very smart , funny , and sexy actress she really done good ! although its not a major fav its good even though people down it they don't have good tatse anyway of what real movies are !
positive	this is the best psychological thriller ever made . it has a great sequence of events and good actors .
positive	my favorite movie of the summer . it was very realistic because they used real characters , settings ( rome ) , and clothing ( armor , weapons ) . this movie made my girlfriend cry . if you like action with out guns , this movie tops it off . the storyline was well written and the acting was good .
positive	i thought it was awsome ! brad pitt rob redford are legends in the field . uh . . . yeah !
positive	another great epic , well , great for me anyway ! . . . . fantastic soundtrack . . . .
positive	a great movie
negative	this was one of the worst movies i have ever witnessed ! how can it be rated so high ?
positive	probably the scariest movie ever made . suspenseful from beginning to end . not a rip-off of an earlier movie as someone else had suggested . as the tag line says : in space-no one can hear you scream .
positive	this is the scariest movie i have ever seen ! it gave me nightmares , as a kid , for 10 yrs ! never forgot this one and the infamous crucifix scene ! i have the limitted edition box set and love the new release ! great classic ! !
positive	what confuses me is why this is in the action section when it should be in the horror section ? strange . anyways , this has got to be one of the best horror tales ever made for the screen ! foster hopkins are excellent as is demme's direction . the atmosphere is good , the tension is unbearable and all of it's praise is well-deserved . excellent movie !
positive	this movie showed the rough times going through high school . many people can relate to this . however , not everyone can do the karate moves .
positive	that movie was almost the funniest movie i have eva seen ! it's really great ! i love richard 4 lyf ! ! !
positive	if you haven't had your heart broken as a teen , wanted to fit in with the crowd , own a fast car , or hesitate to leave your friends after you graduate from high school , you couldn't identify with this movie . i'm not a teen anymore , but i sure recall those great memories . wonderful movie . . .
positive	well written , sensitively directed and superbly acted . the portrayal of captain john miller as a humbly man , a school teacher who only wanted to return home to his wife but never made it , was very moving and highly compelling . my father was a medic on the front lines in wwii , he did make it back home , only he returned with more than just physical scars ; something of which he never talked about , he was a humble man too , as well as a brave man . war flims , art imitating live , what a shame that it has to exist .
positive	i gave it this rating because its the original indiana jones and it had some religious super natural aspects .
negative	driven . . . to the eject button .
positive	this was a great film . fun , fast-paced and lots of twists , like the tv show . the sequel lost it big-time , though .
negative	i had very high expectations of this film given the calber of actors . what a let down . a real snore !
negative	a silly film with bad acting .
positive	being a movie fan , and brought up watching the old epics on the big screen , i never thought i'd ever see them bettered . that is until braveheart . the word masterpiece is used a little to loosely these days ( forrest gump ? ! ! ) , however this film must qualify . mel gibson is a natural director who knows what he is doing . ( roland emmerich please take note ! ) . also great to see patrick mcgoohan in a worthy role . yes , i liked gladiator too , but i have to agree with wiggum on this one , it doesn't hold a candle to braveheart .
positive	i loved and i also that at the end it showed what would happend in real life . so it is great .
negative	what's next , ocean's thirteen , fourteen , etc . ? if you keep adding turkeys , maybe you can drive the ocean series into the negative ratings .
positive	the action was great because of all the special effects . leonardo and kate made the story great because they were both meant for each other . it was a great remake from all the other old remakes .
positive	alfred hitchcock is a genious . an undeniable genious . to all the people unfamiliar with his work and wondering why he is hailed as such should just watch this movie and they will understand . the last scene so stirred me-the way hitchcock blended the ironicies of good and evil was purely brilliant . when the nun emerged from the stairs into the darkness , she appeared an evil , ominious being only to come into the light-a symbol of rightiousness and good-and have to deal with death that she inadvertantly caused . . wow . the rest of the movie was subtley crafted to be gloriously unsettling as well ; it's defiently near the top of my favoritie hitchock movies .
positive	john travolta and nicholas cage were phenomenal . the plot twists in the movie were excellent . i enjoyed the movie very much .
positive	the stone henge scene alone is worth watching this movie , it is hysterical . it shows christopher guest at his best a very funny movie with lots of cameos .
positive	a bunch of stupid , hot , high school cheerleaders running around in their panties and bras ? ! you cant lose !
positive	ernest borgnine is incredible as the sensitive title character . this movie has a lot to say and does it so well through a few characters .
positive	the best movie ever
positive	the best movie ever
positive	wondeful movie . it's just a classic the best ever made . the acting , music and direction are fantastic . a classic forever !
positive	i love adam sandler , especially in this movie . he looks like he would be a great daddy , too bad i can't play the mommy . : )
positive	soooo funny . . . i still cant get over that they had to cuddle in that cave !
positive	absolutey hilarious . i think this is the funniest jim carrey has ever been , i'm still hoping for the sequel .
negative	this was the dumbest movie i have ever seen
positive	hilarious , good special effects , great storyline .
positive	even thinking about this movie makes me chuckle . i just spontaneously start giggling when i think about those characters . yes , the movie is way too crude and raunchy , even for my tastes , but the creativity of eddie murphy's characters makes up for that . this is not shakespeare , so it's not the subtlety of the script i'm interested in . okay , the truth is . . . i fast forward through the dumb parts , but the good parts are really , really good .
positive	actually , this was better than the first one , with elements of humor thrown in with the scares . the director and stars manage to convincingly portray the monster as something to be pitied , and that's not easy to do . it's really sad in a way to watch the final scene where his bride rejects him , because all he really wanted was to be loved .
positive	simply incredible ! ! ! ! you are glued to the screen , very dark , gothic and fast-moving , you are never bored . the evil housekeeper will send chills down your spine ! !
positive	i've seen this movie over a hundred times . it was a bit of a ritual for me and my friends back in high school . it is one of the best fantasy movies of all time . beware the sequels , though ; there can be only one .
negative	i want my $ 9 back , or i'm going to start cracking skulls . . .
positive	who didn't like the goonies ? i have watched this movie at least 100 times and it only gets better . a bunch of unpopular kids follow an old treasure map that belonged to a pirate named one eyed willy . this movie came out when i was a kid and all of my friends love it . as the kids follow the map they are being chased by 3 criminals . they encounter many booby traps along the way and in the end discover one eyed willy's treasure . they save their town and the criminals are arrested . any kid will love this movie .
positive	one of the funniest movies of all time
negative	marrying drew barrymore did not help his movie career .
positive	a good imaginative movie . dorothy gets caught up in a tornado and ends up in a new land where she meets munchkins . , a bad witch , glinda the good witch , scarecrow , tinman , the cowardly lion , along with her new found friends she and toto go off to meet the wizard so he can send her home . they have to deal with the bad witch along the way . there are some good songs in this movie , especially somewhere over the rainbow one of the most famous songs ever . a wonderful fairy tale . judy garland is perfect as dorothy gale . all the actors are good . we still like to watch this movie every now and then . one of the best fantasy movies .
positive	great movie , great action , shows the history !
negative	cheesy sequel that offers nothing . why do they make sequels that are so terrible that they ruin an entire seres ?
positive	i'm a dancer of 9 years and i have never seen such excellent dancing in a movie . i loved it .
positive	i loved this movie ! this is a great blend of animation and regular motion picture . this wasn't the funniest movie , but it was great !
positive	i absolutely loved this movie , infact , i own it ! mel gibson is always a hint that the movie is going to be great . the movie itself was a pleasant mixture of comedy and drama . i laughed , i cried , i was atsonished . i would recommend this to anybody .
positive	i loved this movie ! i saw it on saturday night twice in a row . not my choice . . . but still . i reallu enjoyed it ! !
positive	an american classic . . . jaws is still a great film 20 + years later . robert shaw as quint is a great example of character acting .
negative	another tom green movie that i will never see . who watches this crap and why do the studios keep giving people money to make movies with tom green . the local paper also gave this one no stars and if i could i would . note to hollywood send tom back to canada .
positive	great , wonderful , fabulous movie . it's hard to believe that this was hepburn's first professional role ever , but it was . she won an oscar for best actress and it was certainly deserved . greggory peck was wonderful in his role of the first unsympathetic than the in love reporter . the ending was it had to be . as much as we would love for the handsome peck and lovely hepburn to be together , alas , they cannot . she is a princess and he is a lowly reporter , it would just never work . it was very gratifying to see princess anne stand up for herself a little after her excursion . bottom line : great , classic movie with two terrific actors
negative	b-o-r-i-n-g .
positive	one of the best of the series , and with a classic line too . do you feel lucky punk ? well do you ?
positive	this is such a great classic movie . not because mickey mouse was the lead but all children could be exposed to classic master pieces of music . what a great idea to have great music followed by enteraining graphics . my favorite part is mickey and the powerful hat getting out of control .
positive	i loved this movie . when i first heaaard about a new coumputer animated movie , i recalled the disatrous toy story and other evils , but shrek really was great . filled with warmth and humour and a happy ending . i loved the ending
negative	enough stupid halloween movies .
positive	very entertaining and good action . jet li rules .
negative	i have to agree with an above post when he said . . . poo .
negative	i hate scary movies . i don't get scared really easily and i find it pointless to watch , a waste of time . all the sequels of scream are the same .
positive	much better than the original . it is much more toned down , and takable . the performances are amazing , and i went wild for it .
positive	scared the crap out of me .
positive	this movie goes to the extremes on all fronts . what a rad show !
positive	definitely one of the 3 best bond movies and probably the most iconic viz the golden girl and bond on the laser table . goldfinger himself is also probably the best of the super villains
positive	i think it was an inspirational work about friendship and commitment that eventually developed between the two characters . i liked the way the characters were developed and the changes they experienced throughout the movie .
negative	please take away the pain . .
positive	hitchcock ! i think this was the 1st hitchcock movie i saw and it sucked me right in .
positive	this is like the best movie i have ever seen ! i got the soundtrack and im goign to the movie as soon as it coems out . if you havent seen this movie yet you should see it soon you dotn want to miss out on such a awesome movie !
positive	this movie is so relevant to people as old as i am . people who can remember the wayne's world phenom and snl . this movie has so many great lines , a nd mike myers and dana carvey are so perfect together . the premise is fun . this movie has some of the most memorable lines of any movie of the nineties . great soundtrack , too . wayne's world has changed the way the world looked at bohemian rhapsody !
positive	one of my all-time favorites . outstanding comedy , featuring chaplin at his best , as both the self-effacing barber and the comically tyrannical dictator .
positive	thi is one of my favorite movies . i like the pacino , and the way he acts . he seems so real . i really like the story of how he went from a nobody to a big man and how it ends .
positive	very very funny .
positive	terrific movie , and who couldn't love that donkey . this was truly a very memorable movie that lived up to all it's expectations
positive	i've seen it 20 times and could easily see it 20 more times . great music , comedy , action , and a nice story to boot . and what a cast ! two fried chickens and a coke coming up !
positive	this might be the scariest movie i have ever seen . it seemed like i was jumping out my seat every few minutes .
positive	awesome ! you never knew what was going to happen next . i was on the edge of my seat the whole time . i liked the way it was scary , but not bloody and gross .
positive	mel brooks is a genius ! this has to be one of the funniest movies i have ever seen ! excellent comedy !
positive	just as great as the first .
positive	this movie was great . it gave you the chance to see how people on different sides can come together .
positive	the best movie i've seen all year . after losing my mom last year and these being the first holidays without her , this movie made me laugh . it's an a + in my book . bah hum bug to those that don't like it .
positive	i used to watch it over and over again when i was a kid . it's one of my favorites .
negative	get this movie off the scary movie list please . its a mystery , not a horror flick . plus the movie really blows . i wouldnt watch this movie again if someone gave me $ 40 bucks .
positive	drew barrymore's best film since e . t . ! ! ! in this film , she was kinda like charlie mcgee as an adult ! ! ! especially the scene where she was riding a scooter with her hair flowing in the wind ! ! ! she was a sexy angel ! ! ! the movie had a terrific storyline and plot , and i loved bill murray as bosly ! !
positive	great movie . plenty of action . brilliant acting , particularly from val kilmer as doc holliday , with his witty remarks . the only downfall of the movie would be the love scenes which seem as though they are in the movie simply because they had to be . however , these scenes are few and the rest of the movie is very entertaining . whoever it is saying clint eastwood is in this movie , you've got the wrong film .
positive	alot of fun to watch .
positive	i felt so bad for this poor guy ( szpilman ) ! adrien brody did an excellent job . roman polanski painted a very vivid and disturbing picture of what wwii was like . a great movie . . .
positive	haunting movie , sad story . . . . . . . . .
positive	one of the best movies of the early 70s , and clearly stanley kubrick's masterpiece . a wild , upsetting , shocking exploration of violence . don't rent this movie if you're easily offended . but if you're interested in an extremely well-made movie that offers no easy answers , give it a shot .
positive	stylish and graceful , done in mandarin , not with cheesy cliched american accents , beautiful settings , an authentic chineese feel to it , a solid storyline and great martial arts . definatly martial art .
positive	edward g robinson was still a gangster in this film but a great religious one to watch , especially the parting of the sea . . . . . . . .
positive	i dont know what to say . . . its just the best movie ever .
positive	it has been a long time since i have seen a very well worked and original style of storytelling in a feature film . this film is simply incredible . it manages to be very mysterious , well acted , bravely and honestly directed , humorous and above all gripping . this film sucks you in and refuses to let go . you cannot leave the theater . i had to pee to the point i almost passed out and i still could not tear myself away from this ingeniouse tail . the story is told backward . that is from the last event to the first . what we know is that our main character's , played by guy peirce , wife has been raped and murdered and he is out for revenge . sounds rather run of the mill , right ? well , he witnesses this happen , tries to rescue his wife and gets a severe blow to the head which leaves him with a very strange psychological disorder . he has no short term memory . he has all his old memories he just cannot make any new ones . he most take polaroid pictures and scroll noted in the form of tattos all over his body so that he might track down and kill his wifes murderer . this is what gives this film such a wonderfully twisted and remarkable edge . i haven't seen something told this cool since , dare i say , forever ? this has made my list of the top films of 2001 . memento is a profound and breakthrough film . something that should be considered classic . anyone who enjoys the art of film and story telling should treat themselves to this astonishing work of art . highly highly recommended .
positive	this movie alsolutely rules ! awesome music , emotion , battle scenes , etc . it's also loosely based on history . there is a 300-foot statue of william wallece in scotland . i'm not a big mel gibson fan , but he does a great job in this movie .
positive	this gets a 5 just for the animation , some of the best ever . . . and hand done , with all of the variations within that computer animation just can't seem to capture . the story is a bit cheesy , and just ment to link the animated stories together , but it's still one of my favorites .
positive	what an action movie should be . quite long but you always want to know what happens next so it is okay . exactly the right amount of comedy , plenty of action and tom arnold was brilliant as the annoying sidekick to arnie .
positive	great competitive movie with a sense of humor that was also emotionally tear jerking at the end , but it ended well . i would go see it again .
positive	the comedy of sinister , impeccable manners , as louis d'ascoygne ( dennis price ) fulfills in his own way his late mother's wish that he inherit the family fortune , enacting indiscriminate and caculated revenge upon a half-dozen family members , all of whom stand between himself and the inheritance . that alec guinness portrays the parts of eight of the victims is remarkable enough but is one of the lesser delights . price himself is impeccable in character in his psychotic obsession and joan greenwood ( also wonderful in oscar wilde's 'the importance of being earnest' , 1952 ) teaches all comediennes a thing or two about playing the role of the seductive blackmailing adulteress who also happens to be the object of louis' desire ( that's right ) . wilde , as well as chesterton and woodehouse , knew that british comedy is nothing if not the collusion of characters , eccentric and batty .
positive	this movie is probably the best one i have seen for the year of 2000 so far . the battle scenes were outstanding . the character , maximus , was a bad ass . it was like a love story and an action movie all in one . the story of the movie was good . direction was outstanding .
positive	i think there's a lot of things we could say about this movie ; tim robbins and jeff bridges were unbelievable ; great movie !
positive	i'll tell you , this movie is incredibly deep , intelligent , awesome , fun-to-watch , interconnected , mind-tweaking , and insanely thought-out this marvel of a movie actually is . in fact , don't even try to understand the whole thing the first time you watch it . it isn't physically possible . this movie has so much freakin' content that even the people who claim that i'm wrong , and that they do get it the first time , are in fact wrong . they don't get it . in fact , i'd bet even i don't get the whole entire thing , in spite of the fact that i've seen it at least ten times . there are whole websites devoted to simply the philosophy implied by the matrix . to be fair , critics have an obligation to be mean and lie and make fun of every single movie . ( ok , a bit of an exaggeration ) . this is why even the most accommidating critics simply musn't be letting their true feelings show through . either that , or they're asses . to complement the impossible-to-comment-on , blaringly incredible storyline , comes a revolution in visual effects . larry and andy have freakin' fired the bar out of a cannon . the technique that bullet-time , from the first movie , suggests , is fully realized in the second installment . namely , a virtual camera . the scene is completely mapped out on a computer , in three dimensions , allowing absolutely any angle and motion of the view to be manifested . in the burly brawl , a flesh-and-blood camera would have been torn to pieces if it had actually gone through the motions suggested by the virtual camera . tight , fast turns and swings in slow motion would have required even tighter , faster turns and swings in real-time , to which the real camera is eternally bound . the series was originally designed to be one single story , but it was way too long to put together into one movie . dude , this movie would have been incredible if it was animated ! the story alone would have made it a blockbuster . no , more ! visual effects that were actually invented for this movie make it stunning to watch . when the second , or especially third , movie is over , you're body will be jittering from adrenaline and sore , and you will have had chills at least two or three times . your mind will race and scour every frame and you will be addicted to it . watching it for the second time , you will actually be able to watch it .
positive	a great sci fi movie . awesome cast , awesome effects , nice story line and well ahead of it's time .
positive	fantastically funny film . martin the ending makes you warm inside .
negative	have you ever seen such decent special effects ruined by such awful acting ? don't make a historical film if you are going to turn it into a cheesy romance film . . . doesn't hollywood have more respect for old veterans ? typical hollywood shlock- overhyped , overdone , overacted . a real dissapointment .
positive	one of my favorites . although i think keanu sux in just about everything he does and i also think the same about wynona ryder , the movie had such a great script and gary oldman is an incredible actor , that it was worth seeing at the theatre . copola did an excellent job of direction ( look what he had to struggle w / though ) .
positive	a classic movie that is a fairy tale , action-adventure and comedy .
positive	i love this movie even though i am not a big fan of jim carey . this movie is sooooo funny ! i have seen it a lot with my best friend but , we still crack up through most of the movie .
positive	this film is a true gem . it's one of the best quasi-documentary send ups i've ever seen . don't let the subject matter fool or deter you , see this film ! ! ! dutchvu
positive	rocky is a symbol of underpriviledged america rising up from the depths to overcome all odds and be a champion . although rocky doesn't win the fight , he truly is the victor . i've seen this movie over twenty times and i still love it .
positive	this movie was so ahead of its time . no special effects and slice n dice , just pure suspense . i still get the creeps when i watch it .
positive	this movie defined what scary movies should be like . alfred hitchcock was a genius for his time . he set the standard for these types of movies . the shower scene is and will always be the best scene in any movie . the way they made it was great .
positive	the best war movie of all time ! very smart . all around bad ass !
positive	best movies i've ever seen ! ! !
positive	an enchanting , inspired claymation oscar-winning classic from the brilliant british animator nick park . the best of the marvellous adventures of wallace and gromit ( the immensely likeable owner and dog ) - this time involving a pair of mechanical trousers and a villainous museum-robbing penguin who lodges at their home ! equally appealing for adults and children , and a must-see for anyone unfamiliar with the delightful series .
positive	i loved it . where else can you see life prtrayed through the eyes of a house . it's the story of a dying man , and his messed up life . or it's the story of a messed up man and his dying house . or it's the story of a man with a messed up family and the growth of the family right along with the growth of his house . or , it's all of those , or it's none of those . it's just a great movie . even if you're a guy who doesn't cry , bring the kleenex along for this one . nobody's eyes will stay dry .
negative	while reading your opinions on this movie i was astonished . in all sincerity i can't image how you guys could have possibly seen this movie for more than a vulgar pornographic flick . i can't believe that seventeen year old children can walk in off the street and see this film , for this our society's moral standards should be reviewed . one would have to agree that all played their roles well . . they were all full of emotion and very dramatic . still i just can't see how anyone would find a film that makes sex look so dirty , so amazingly good . most at our show left appauled . anyone who enjoys this movie would have to be slightly twisted and lacking something in their own sexual relations . i just really feel that this movie should have been rated nc-17 .
negative	you know , where do i begin with the pile of trash ? first of all , i refuse to believe a tornado is powerful enough to whip a cow around 700 times , but isn't powerful enough to throw the truck they drive off the road . oh , and id swear the plot of this movie simply revolved around knocking over tornado tracking devices ! hellooooo , is there any intelligence left in hollywood ? ? ? and i love the fact that the tornado comes , clouds are black . . . yet not one drop of freakin rain ! and if i see a tornado , i don't know about you , but i'm running the opposite direction , i sure as hell aint going to chase it down like these retarded idiots ! the movie sucked !
negative	i think this is beyond all bounds the worst of the child play franchise . the only frightning moments in this peice were the parts that had people trying to act and the horrible dialogue is spoken . the low production costs and crap idea make this one of the worst child's play movies and one of the worst horror films ever made . complete poo .
positive	it was an excellent movie ! ! ! ! ! i loved it ! ! ! ! !
positive	a good original movie . a lot of movies are based from this one . good special effects for that time . one of the best storylines .
positive	the funniest movie i have seen in my entire life . such in incredible comedic feat will take a huge comedy to parralell . tom green did a spectacular job . a must see .
negative	dumbest movie i have ever seen !
positive	creepy as hell and i am not just talking about the hotel itself
positive	the most moving film i have ever seen . it changed the way i thought .
positive	the title speaks for it all . ya gotta know spanish to understand the title !
positive	the absolute best movie of all time ! i give it more than 5 stars .
positive	robin williams gave it his best shot to become accepted as a bonified human . . ! the longer the movie played the more involved it became . great specail effects and thoroughly enjoyed . except for the ending . . . don't take this wrong robin williams . . . but your supposed to keep us laughing our virtual butts off . . . . got that ? but you somehow managed to bring it into the realms of real tears . so knock that tears stuff off mr . williams or . . . no-more 'dura cell' batterys for you dude . got that ?
positive	a powerful punch of a movie . tough hard hitting drama , with edward norton as the nameless star . pitt and bonham-carter are excellent in support . but this is finchers film , his direction is faultless , crafting the music , orchestrating the editing to weave his magic .
positive	the movie takes you right into the heart of teams . . . . lots of driver and team member perspectives as well . excellent racing footage , and good background information . both old and new nascar fans will enjoy and learn something from this movie .
positive	this was a very moving movie and brought to life interesting aspects of the civil war .
positive	as a bonafide brazil-phile , i must admit my bias here . regardless i found this to be the best brazilian film since amor bandido ( 1979 ) . the relationship between the child and adult woman who finds him living in the train station is engrossing . what i liked most about this film however was it's sheer believeability - sadly the phenomenon of street kids does exists there , thus , there's a subtle dose of social commentary mixed in with a gripping storyline . recommended .
negative	i rated armageddon a 1 b / c it is a heavily hyped movie w / no plot , no good acting and a sick technology will save us-america can do anything metality !
positive	i think the scariest part of the movie is knowing that this is based on a true story . i was freaked out since the first sceen begain . i had no idea what i was in for . awsome , awsome movie and i am excited to see the remake when it comes out . that will be cool seeing them try to do the same thing as the original .
positive	very well done , an accurate portrayal of the life of george patton .
negative	i loath this film . what a waste of the talented miss angelina jolie and production costs . they could have made twelve films the size of girl , interrupted with that budget . there is no plot . there is no entertaining action sequences . there are no interesting characters . there are no interesting back stories . there are parts where they tried to add in comic relief but it came off as dull pointless chatter . most of the dialouge in this film was so mind numbing all i could hear were clicking sounds . angelina jolie is still one very attractive woman and this film proves it once again , yes , i would like to get hot and heavy with this vixen . beyond that this film has nothing . absolutly nothing . it is a summer movie . but those are usually entertaining ! i have never been so bored in an action film in my entire friggin life ! there is a funny part though . in the beginning there is a shower scene with lara croft ( which shows more skin than the usual pg-13 fair ) and later on is a part where we think we are about to be treated to another lara croft shower scene , when all of a sudden it pans down to reveal . . . a man ! ! ! only laugh out loud part of the movie . all the guys were like oh yea ! ! ! then the camera pans down to reveal a square chin covered in stubble and a receeeding hair line ahhh sh * t , man ! great moment . i wonder if the film makers did this intentionally ?
positive	this movie is so good to me , i watch all of them . this is my most favorite movies .
positive	this movie paints an incredible picture of a gambling addict . john anthony ( mccoughnahay ) is a stellar ex-college athlete who's career was ended by an injury . the guy sits around an office and is more or less miserable when he catches a big break due to his knack for sports gambling , and he goes from basically a farmboy to a nyc hot-shot overnight . he rises and falls quickly but he's not the guy with the problem - that's walter ( pacino ) . he lives not for the thrill of victory but for the defeat . he explains that gambling addicts are not actually addicted to winning - it's losing that they crave . it's that moment when you know you've got it all on the line , everything you own is riding on one bet . . . nothing can match that high . renee russo is excellent in her supporting role as walter's wife who refuses to give up on him .
positive	i just saw this last night ! i think that sean and julia are great actors and to me save the last dance should be the number 1 movie in america . but that is just me . it rocked
positive	the lord of the rings ; the fellowship of the ring is definetly the best movie ever made ! i wish i could give it a higher rating but i can't ! if there was a 1 , 000 , 000 i would definetly rate it with that ! anyone who doesn't like it doesn't understand it needs to go to a mental hospital !
negative	is this a joke ? why would i watch this crap for $ 10 when i can stay at home and see it for free on mtv or fox . whoever came up with this idea is an idiot .
positive	on of the stupidest very funny movies of all time . great from start to finish .
positive	funny ! romantic ! adventurous ! action packed ! what more can you ask for in a movie ? it's a classic and one of my all time favorites .
negative	what the hell were they thinking when they came up with this movie idea , its sucks , one of the most boring movie i have seen
positive	2 breakfasts please ! lol da two yutes . . . the what ? 'da two yutes' . . did you say yutes ? 'sorry your honor the two yoouuuthhzzzzz ! this movie was cute and funny from start to finish . the scene on the porch of the cabin between joe peci' and marisa tomei was hysterical . . . as was the scene when his suit gets ruined and he has to walk into court wearing a ridiculous suit from the mid 1800's that he got at a second hand store . im laughing just thinking about it .
positive	just an amazing story , awsome cinematogrophy , and the best performance tom hankes has done . the story of a stupid person that never does anything actually stupid . he just kinds of floats by so many historical moments and has such big roll in history he is not even aware of . he grows up alabama raised by just his mother barly makes into public school , but insup being on the national football league because of his ability run fast . from then on he meets three presidents , serves in vietnam , is awarded the medal of honor , speakes infront of thousands during a war protest , gos to china and plays in the world ping-pong championship , uncovers the watergate scandle , starts the biggest scrimpin company in america , is one of the original investors in micresoft , and runs for three years straight across the country . obviously he has an exciting life , but after advevture always returns to his home in alabama . an epoc film , and historicly amazing . you will never see life the same once you have seen it through the eyes of forrest gump
positive	this has been one of my favourite movies for years and years : ) i've read the book as well , and i think the cast was very well-chosen , the historical account well told , and the story - of course - riveting ! this is a true classic , and it's pretty easy to see why !
negative	this is a comedy ? i can't believe people rated it this high - not funny to me .
negative	oh my god . as if the first sequel wasn't bad enough , they had to make another scream movie . . oh well , what can you do , right ? a couple of good things though . they brought randy back ( even if it was in a video ) and it was nice to see jay and silent bob , but that was about it . not keeping with the scream tradition , there was only one killer who turned out to be a character whom wich we knew absolutely nothing about and was only introduced to us once . i mean , it could have been anyone , the pissed off brother or john q . walk-on . another thing , where did everyone get those bullet proof vests ? a cute attempt to try and finish off the scream movies , but sorry guys , you failed miserably .
positive	my favorite adam sandler movie . i loved when he would see and talk to the penguin .
negative	that was the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my life . there was no plot whatsoever and the story line that was very shallow was pathetic . i hated this movie !
positive	i have always loved this sweet little tale about lady the pampered cocker spaniel and tramp the homeless mutt . their worlds were different until they came together when the nasty aunt who was babysitting { while lady's owners were out of town } tried to put a collar on lady . they ran away . the scene at the restaurant where they share a plate of spaghetti is precious . there are other dog characters too . peg the dog the dog who has been around some humerous scenes some sad . of course all ends well with a happy ending and a new home for tramp . cute disney i loved from my childhood and still enjoy .
positive	i like it better than the gocfather , but for one reason i think i always miss the subtle genius of the godfather movies . . .
positive	this is definitely the best disney movie ever .
positive	this movie was inventive , bizzare , and some how lovable , the end was a little weird but good ! i didn't expect a musical .
positive	this is probally my favortie scary movie of all times i like the first one a lot better than the 2nd or 3rd
positive	it was better than the first because the first was setting up the story so teh second had more action . kinda like episode iv and v from star wars . i also loved it because it had nightcrawler . x3 is coming out in may . update : i may not see x3 since i have heard they may not have nightcrawler in it and he was one of the best in the movie . they may do a wolverine movie which means a slice and dice movie .
positive	the director is an heir of hitchcock . it is a movie very different from what french people usually do , but you won't be disappointed !
positive	masterful , concise , dubious , chilling , real . loved it .
positive	this one was better than the first one cuz that buffy blonde really got on my nerves
positive	i understand that it is a highly offensive movie , but if you are willing to let yourself go and just laugh at the jokes it turns out to be one of the funniest movies around . if nothing else at least fastforward through everything , but the songs . the music makes the movie worth watching and deserving of at least a four star rating by itself .
positive	just a good movie . really nothing of merit dramawise , nor acting that could be called great . it just somehow works . keeps you interested from the begining untill the end . good movie . ijr says check it out !
negative	what is soo great about this movie i dont see anything
positive	not only is it wonderfully done and incredibly suspenseful , it has an extremely deep story and the script is witty and wonderful . perhaps best of all , tony perkins shines like no other performance in cinema as norman bates .
positive	heart breaking . the mother daughter dynamic was tough to swallow . perfectly acted by the main cast and told in an unrushed and sincere manner befitting the story .
positive	this is a great romantic movie . woody allen at his best . annie hall is funny everytime you watch it .
positive	it leaves you with a sense of conclusion and gives a twist to what you thought the ending would be .
positive	very confusing , i had to watch it a bunch of times to get the story line , but once i did i loved this movie . only for smart people . kubrick has a way of doing that . the scariest movie i've ever seen and it wasn't a horror movie . not a feel good movie but i like that , it keeps you thinking ( if you have sense enough to stay awake ) . great though .
negative	the movie and the book are two different things . the book was told from one perspective , and the movie from another . the book gave specific details about the characters , the movie didn't give anything but the name of the character . some of the scenes in the movie did happen in the book , but most of the major scenes from the book never made it into the movie .
positive	a very good movie . bette davis plays a famous stage actress margo channing . eve is a young actress want to be who claims to be a huge fan of margo channing she even charms her way into margo channings life by moving in with her as an assistant . time goes by and we see that eve is not the sweet doting fan she pretends to be . it turns out that eve wants to be an actress and we see she will stop at nothing to get what she wants . bette davis is great as the getting older margo { if you can call 40 old ! } who trusted eve and was later betrayed by her . marilyn monroe has a small role in the movie too . all the actors are good in their roles . a little too long but a very good movie .
positive	there is nit enough stars in the night sky to rate this movie . pure horror . and i know horror .
positive	stanley kubrick's masterpiece ! that's all i gotta say !
positive	i love all the characters in this movie . they are all excellent actors and actresses . definitely , this is a five-star movie .
positive	if a horror film is supposed to scare the be jesus ( sp ? ) out of people then this is one helluva horror film . i hate horror movies , hate 'em . partly because i think they're usually kinda cheesey and partly because , . . well 'cause they're scary but this one is really scary . i must've seen this when i was about 10 or so and it totally freaked me out .
positive	i do love this film . the only problem i have is the script . no doubt cameron put his hand in it big time . i really do think he should stick to teh producing and directing . to me terminator is more a love story than anything else . the main storyline is to keep sarah conner alive so she conceives her son john who will help mankind to beat the cybertech computer system . reece gets sent back by john conner , john knows that reece is his dad and has to be sent back ( i know , it gets complicated ) arnie was originally meant to play the part of reece , but both himself and cameron thought he'd be better as the terminator . the sfx are very good considering when it was done .
positive	this movie is amazing . its every teens dream to be like ferris . he is just so funny , and so cool , and its an all around great movie .
negative	the only reason the real life guy was awarded the nobel prize was out of pity . they had to dredge up some obscure theory from his graduate days that wasnt nonsense and pretend it was something relevant to today .
negative	i have a question about this movie : the whole thing is that if you make a copy of the tape , you wont die . ( it was discovered at the end ) . rachel made a copy of the tape at the begining of the movie , but why through out the entire movie rachel is having all these symptoms and signs as if she was going to die ? ( bloody noses , blurry picture , hair coming out of her throat etc . ) it's hard for me to watch this movie thinking that .
positive	its the most amazingly innocent-humoured fil ever ! there are some classic characters ( the black knight , nights who say neep , killer rabbit , ) and its just an azaming experience ! ! i would recommend it to anyone !
positive	this movie was marvelous . i have always been a fan of tolkien and fantasy as a genre . when they announced that someone was making the fellowship of the ring into a movie i was half over-joyed and half wary of what they may do to the story . but after seeing the movie i'm extremely impressed and cannot wait until the next installment comes out this december . the acting was wonderful , the characters were exactly as they should be and the sets and special effects . . . they were just amazing . this movie is a beautiful movie in so many ways . go see it , that's all i can say . . . just go see it .
positive	gypsy is a great musical starring natalie wood as gypsy rose lee and rosalind russel as the mother . they made a later version with bette midler , but this one is clearly the better one .
positive	really good screenplay . it should have gotten an award .
negative	this movie had the potential to be very good . i thought it was great for the first three minutes . then it turns out that cats and dogs are smarter than humans , and they use all of these james bond type equipment to fight each other . it's so unreal that i wanted to hurl !
positive	the big daddy of all the family films . a wonderful fantasy about dorothy getting whisked off to oz and meeting up with many memorable characters . you could see this a hundred times and not get tired .
negative	i did not get this on at all you've folks jumping around like they are in the matrix and no one seems to know why . a couple of nice fight scenes but on a whole way over rated .
positive	i love this movie ! ! ! it is the most beautiful movie i have seen in a long time ! it makes me cry everytime i watch it ! ! ! i will eventually buy it and will watch it all the time until the disc no longer plays ! !
positive	this is one of the favorite movies of my youth . even though it's a period film , it's really funny . the actor who played the main character did a great job .
positive	armageddon had various themes leading to one overall . i liked the movie because it was interesting . the cast was great . liv tyler is the best !
positive	while visiting my 78-year old dad , we watched it on amc . unbeknownst to me , my pop seems to have watched this movie a dozen times and knew every line and every scene like so many rocky horror revelers . though i am not the biggest john wayne fan , this one is great . the veiled sexuality between wayne and sizzling hot red-head acollene maureen o'hara is palpable -- even in 1952 . it was neat when o'hara confides a very discreet issue on their inability to consummate their marriage with the town priest ( ward bond ) in gaelic . victor mclaglan and the duke have one of the best hollywood fights in history . the irish locales are visually stunning . overall , a real treat i was glad to share with pops . seek it out .
negative	by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life ! i had to wake my boyfriend up so we could leave . half of the movie theater walked out , i have never seen that happen before .
positive	this movie was really cool ! ! !
negative	you mean all you have to do is make a copy of the tape and you're safe ? what if you gave someone a copy ? would they still have to make a copy of the copy ? what if you copied it onto dvd ? what if you copied over one of youre dukes of hazzard episodes ? would rosco p . coltraine step out of you're tv . that would be sweet .
positive	bad ass movie ! great acting and storyline . good movie !
positive	shaft is an excellent movie to see . samuel l . jackson plays a great shaft . he also looks very cute with a bald head . will smith was asked to play the part , but i am glad samuel l . jackson got the part because he is a more serious actor .
positive	this was an excellent french film by the woman who starred in amelie . has some french regulars . very engaging film taking place during world war i , about a polio infected woman searching for her lost lover who is missing in action as the war comes to an end . very complex plot that unfolds beautifully . jodie foster plays a part in it , which eliminated the film from contention for best foreign film category at the academy awards .
positive	i love this movie ! a great teen film about love and skiing and trying to kill yourself .
negative	laugh out loud funny . just goes to show you that no matter what year it is or far the human race has progressed that whenever someone is told to never turn your back on the knife wielding maniac that carves human hides for a hobby than the jack ass is going get stabbed from behind .
positive	what do you do when jack goes mad ? truly one of the foundations of horror today . this movie is well , monumentary . amazing performance by jack nicholson who plays a winter caretaker of the overlook hotel , who slowly turns mad throughout the movie to the point of trying to kill his family who is staying at the hotel with him for the winter . its great to see jack's amazing acting ability shine as you watch madness slowly possess his mind throughout the movie until he turns into this beast at the climax in one of the most memorable chase scenes in movie history . scince its from stanley kubrick , the director of clockwork orange , you know that it promises to be visualy stunning . a must see for any true horror fans out there .
positive	i love this guy he is so asome this is how batman would be if he was half human and half vanpire .
positive	austin powers was incredibly funny . i think most of its hilarity originated from the clever script and the idea of spoofing the spy movies . also , the sophomoric gags kept me rolling with laughter .
positive	madonna . . 5 stars all the way . . and an oscar ! !
negative	it is on my list of ten worst movies i've ever saw ( or in this case slept through ) . it had all the suspense of a half-hearted game of clue jr . , the story was meandering and wearisome , and the sound quality of the dvd , coupled with the bad british accents made most of the movie sound mushy and inaudible . it was so painfully boring that we rented it for a whole week and popped it in our dvd player 4 nights and fell in and out of repose all week . by the time i woke up for the ending where they reveal whodunit , i commented , i don't even know who they f--k got killed , and angrilly went back to sleep . i don't dig robert ( i hate america ) altman movies . i don't understand why every big-time actor has to make an appearance in an altman movie . must be some coastal elite blue states liberal thing .
positive	if one film could incapsulate the self-indulgence of the eighties onto a single piece of celluloid , it would be this one . al pacino plays arguably the greatest role of his prestigious career in his performance of tony montana , an ironic personification of the american dream . tony is a lowly career criminal who comes to america from communist cuba with little more than the shirt on his back and a gleam in his eye . fueled by his newly liberated sense of desire , he goes from rags to riches ( dealing in yayo , naturally ) . in doing so though , he becomes lax , decadent and obsessed with money . this action packed tale is a vividly painted portrait of the double-edged sword that is desire . the plentiful action scenes are inventive and pacino lends a infectious intensity to them . oh yes , it's funny too . pacino's portrayal of the exaggeratedly crude montana is side-splitting as he spouts language that would make howard stern wince . scarface is the complete package , a true epic and every minute is infused with vibrant creativity .
positive	great musical movie . i enjoy how the guys can sing and still act macho in the movie . good acting and funny yet sad movie .
positive	damn that indian dude who like wrote and directed that movie is a genius . his movies are just so fu * * in unique . all the movies are crap now , but damn this movie is phat .
positive	it was very funny and i liked it mike myers is very funny .
positive	scarface . a classic . one of the best original gangsta movies of all time . i can never get tired of seeing it over and over again .
positive	terrific movie . the best teen movie since clueless .
positive	sixth sense is my all time favorite horror movie . i watch horror movies all the time , so it takes a lot for a movie to make me jump . sixth sense not only made me jump , but had me crying for my mom and gripping my best friends hand throughout the entire movie . from the moment the guy is in bruce willis' bathroom , to the end where haley's character is in the car with his mom at an accident scene , you are petrified with fear . i was so scared after the movie that i had to read happy children's books , and sleep in bed with my sister with the light on all night . i've never been that scared after a movie . i think the reason the movie had such an effect on me because i've always felt that there are beings around us at all times , we just can't see them .
positive	an excellent film about a boy's lifelong friendship with a man who runs the cinema in his small hometown . the ending almost made me cry , and i never cry at movies .
negative	excrement on a stick . no , retract that . not quite that good .
positive	an absolute joy to watch matt damons best ever character , and jay and silent bob are at their absolute best in this feature , i have this on vhs and it is now unwatchable due to the wear and tear it has endured , and the religious factor is beautifully done . i could go on for hours about this movie but i wont ( no applause needed ) .
negative	didn't like it at all . jack nicholson is a great actor but the other cast members weren't that good . i just hated the storyline .
positive	this movie gives insight to a woman's life that is a major part of history . until i saw this movie i did not realize what kind of life she went through . i am glad that the storyline wasn't changed too drastically from the actual historical events .
positive	palpatine continues his conquest of domination and destruction of the republic . he looks a little more tired in this one because the quest for galactic domination is taking its strain . similar to phantom menace in that palpatine keeps pushing and gaining a stronger hold on the senate by not just being chancellor this time but gets the senate to elect him as a supreme commander / dictator to still the turmoil brought on by the trade federation . again palpatine is playing the trade federation , he used them in phantom menace to get elected chancellor , and here he uses them to get the clone army approved by the senate , and to gain ultimate control over the republic . at the same time he gets some termites who make battle droids for the trade federation to construct plans for a death star . and has count dooku deliver them to him on coruscant . i like dooku much more than darth maul who was all braun and no brains . i think palpatine will have a bit of trouble in getting rid of dooku , he is going to have to really work at out smarting dooku in the next film , because there can be only one emperor . jango fett continues the badass image of the fett's we got from boba in the old movies . i look forward to seeing boba in action in the third movie , because the effects with jango were excellent , he exemplifies everything a bounty hunter should be in the star wars universe . and what i wish i could have seen boba doing in the battle at the sarlacc pit in jedi . an unfitting end in movie history if i ever saw one . take his head off with a lightsabre or call it a draw , anything but igniting his jetpack by mistake and sending him headfirst into jabbas skiff then tumbling into the mouth of the sarlacc . kinda ironic it was a misfire of jangos jetpack that did him in . or was it ? and by the way how come all the stormtroopers in the early films are so easy to killoff if they are all clones of jango should they not be a little more deadly and inventive . guess its the inbreeding over 30 years . nuff said . attack of the clones is a fun movie and nice addition to the star wars saga .
negative	x-men was more of a movie for kids . it's a movie that has no point . the ending makes no sense and resolves nothing . x-men is a cartoon that should remain a cartoon .
positive	arguably taratino's best film , this one packs in the most excitement and the best writing . harvey keitel is excellent as mr . white and steve buscemi plays a wonderful mr . pink , but tim roth is the real show stopper as mr . orange ( freddy nuindike ) . tarantino make an appearance as mr . brown and lawrence tierney is a tough but funny crime boss . michael madsen's mr . white cahracter get to have most of the fun ( i . e . cutting the ear of of marvin nash the captured police officer , and generally playing it cool ) . the constant backdrop of k-billy's super sounds of the seventies makes the perfect frame for this film . best scene : are you gonna bark all day little doggy , or are you gonna bite ?
positive	i had nightmares yaaaaaaaaay !
positive	hillarious !
positive	hillarious !
negative	anyone that watches south park has to be a goof . i mean , the show holds the record for most profanities . this show gets a movie , but frasier doesn't ! or star trek : deep space nine ! or home improvement ! it's crazy , i tell you . avoid this movie at all costs . it isn't rated-r for nothing you know . . .
positive	one of the funniest films of all time . . never once have i not laughed . and dont forget . . he is not the messiah , he ` s a very naughty boy
positive	well . . . i just went to go see this movie today and i must say this is histerical ! ! ! it is a must see . . . the movie is about america's most loved couple breaking ^ and the people not liking them as much b / c they are not together . then someone has been hired to try and bring them back together , but the movie brings surprises and great entertainment so go c it ! ! the actors and actresses in it are as follows : julia roberts , billy christal , john cusack , and catherine zeta jones . . . oh and the adorable seth green is in it toooooo ! ! ! ! catherine zeta jones and john cusack are the famous couple that split ^ . . . and julia roberts is the sister of catherine zeta jones , and billy christal is the man hired to get them back together and seth green is billy chrystal's assistant . . . . it is very cute ! ! did yall know that julia roberts was offered the part as gwen , catherine zeta jones' part . oh and if u have seen the movie or the previews the parts w / the dogs by billy christal's crotch . . . wasn't suppose ta be in the movie . . . . and in my opinion was the funniest part . . heheehe it is sooo great u hvae to c it . . i highly recommend it ! ! ! : )
positive	'it's such a perfect day , i'm glad i spent it with you ! ' i very darkly humoured look at heroin addiction in edinburgh . sharp , wittly , caustic and full on intelligent social commentary . the film which propelled ewan mcgregor towards hollywood stardom . robert carlyle gives his best performance i've seen to date as the dysfunctional alcoholic begbie . if you liked this try watching shallow grave . not quite as good but still has danny bolye's tar black sense of humour .
negative	utter garbage . if jude law's career can survive that it can survive anything .
positive	reservoir dogs is quentin tarantino's best film and arguably one of the best films , period . it was very cutting edge in it's time and remains so several years of technique evolution later , and will undoubtedly continue to be far into the future . this film twists your imagination and destroys your morals and you'll love it like nothing else . go see this movie !
positive	what a classic ! from the gripping storyline to the ultimately cool finale this film will rest in your imagination for a long time . kevin spacey is magnetic and along with some good support , this makes a classic film noir / thriller
positive	one of my favorite films ever . i love the dialogue , the characters , the story , everything . kevin smith is a genious in his own right .
positive	barbara streisand was great as fannie brice , the performer from the early to mid 1900s . there are some good songs such as don't rain in my parade , and i'm the greatest star . the roller skating scene is funny . other numbers are good as well .
negative	possibly the worst piece of crap ever made . some of adam sandler's movies are funny , such as happy gilmore and big daddy , but this movie was ridiculous .
positive	this is a great movie . it has a good story and is scary as hell .
positive	yet another spin on the whole origin of the vampire , yet a new history and a new take on the werewolf origin as well , but at least this one gives the werewolf story abetter beginning than the old and tired wolf bites human makes him a werewolf story . however , the new breed of werevamp is not my fav . i thought they pulled it off well , but surely they could have made him look better than that ! ! altogether , i think this movie was great . we can't wait for evolution ! ! !
positive	exhilarating entertainment , particularly the opening fight scene between two women on the rooftop that took my breath away . it is a tossup between this and gladiator as to which is best picture of the year . this has everything in it -- action sequences never before put on film , two love stories , mysticism , teen rebellion . ang lee himself described this as sense and sensibility with martial arts . people don't realize that lee brought together some of the greatest talent in the world . michael yeoh , who should have been nominated for an academy award , and chow yun fat , are not only the biggest stars in asia but have appeared in big american studio movies . the man who choreographed the fight scenes has been called the best in the business for his work on the matrix , but what he has done here goes way beyond that . and all of the lines in movie , delivered in mandarin , had to be learned from scratch by all the actors , none of whom knew the language previously . see it and believe it .
positive	bruce lee's last movie is nice and more intense . my favorite part is when he killed o'hara for the self-sacrificing of his sister . then , the part when he fought in a one on one and also in the room of mirrors , where he finally found a way to kill him with a single fierce kick . my favorite part is when he is showing how quick he is with nunchuks . this movie is cool .
negative	ha ! this movie blew ! it was some pathetic goth kid's wet dream
positive	if you love movies and comics , this is the perfect movie for you . i thought that x-men had to be one of the best movies of the year . i was just overwhelmed by all the special effects and how close the movie was to the comic book . it was worth my money to see .
positive	there were several chracteristics that made this an excellent movie . first , it had a good blend of humor , second , the action sequences were mild enough for all audiences , and third , the language was controlled .
positive	one of my favorite movies . . . love adam and drew together !
positive	i am willing to bet that many people have never heard of autism before , and i give this movie credit for bringing it to the public's attention . the film is an excelent way of showing that a mental disability does not necessarily mean low intelegence . plus , i loved watching tom cruise freak out constantly in this film ; provided real comic relief from the drama .
negative	um , i'm pretty sure the british stole the enigma machine from the germans , not the americans , guess the lads in continuity missed that fact
negative	when humor this crude and mean-spirited is considered one of the greatest comedies ever by so many people , i am convinced that our society has pretty much totally lost it .
positive	see the new bruce lee in movies ! awesome action-packed movie with great fighting scenes . must see if you like bruce lee !
positive	i'll be damned if i ever figured out the plot , and i don't think raymond chandler and howard hawks ever did , either . so what ? bogie , bacall , snappy patter , classy dames , and everyone smoked , since you were more likely to get plugged in the back than live long enough to get cancer . . . . those were the days ! the remake in 1978 , with mitchum ( who made a pretty good marlow ) and sarah miles just didn't work , since they inexplicably transferred it all to england . and film noir just doesn't make it in color .
positive	i loved this movie . i went and saw it twice . the actors are great and in some parts the whole audiance at the theater was laughing for 5 minutes straight ! ! i love it ! ! !
positive	love the whole series . i'm a sucker for this kind of humor .
positive	i loved the magic of the movie especially orlando bloom's portrayal of legolas . i can't wait for the next movie !
positive	hey guys , comment on this movie ! it's great ! top 15 hitchcocks !
positive	this movie isn't going to win any awards , but i think it was a cute movie .
positive	this is a wonderfully crafted film . the imagery is amazing , brilliant colors are used in a way to convey feelings in the heaven scene , and then dark colors for hell are used to convey that . the story is profound and invokes thought . robin williams does a good acting job .
negative	another total waste of space from america's most popular pot smoking duo . . . a completely idiotic movie in every way . . . no point whatsoever . . . do not waste your hard earned money buying this junk . . .
positive	oh boy . . . . . the matrix , its a funny thing but here am i looking at this thing , wondering , yes wondering . could this be true , is it really going on ! ? well . . . . . . sorta like that . i've been reading a book in the bible called ephesians this book written by someone named apostle paul he was in prison writting to this particular people telling , explaining who they are and what they are supposed to be doing . lets forget this traditional stuff and move on to the real , present , future ! the matrix is only a sci-fi reflection of the truth -----neo saves so does jesus christ .
positive	son , you gotta a panty on your head . .
positive	thankfully pixar's deal with disney is coming to an end so they can make great films without having that sickening disney touch to it . i absolutely loved this film as did the seven guys who i watched it with did . the animation is out of this world and the characters are very funny . do love the seagulls - 'mate , mate , mate . . . . '
positive	great movie . jack nicholson plays nasty melvin who cannot be nice to others and has terrible insults for almost everyone . he has a crush on a waitress played by helen hunt . his neighbor a gay man who is an artist is attacked and put in the hospital . melvin is forced to take care of the neighbors dog while the man is in the hospital . things change from that point on melvin grows to like the dog and he becomes a nicer person . he helps out the waitress who has a sick son . i like the fact that this little dog makes a change for the better in a man who could not reach out to others , melvin slowly changes into a nicer person { not perfect , but nicer . } i loved the movie and still enjoy watching it .
positive	i love bruce lee . he's a great actor . he does great karate . he fights well .
positive	this sequel chronicles anakin skywalker and how he started to turn evil . great battle scenes , music , special effects , and an excellent plot .
positive	one of the best films of the last 20 yrs . never been anything like it since .
positive	great special effects , good sense of magic and wonder .
positive	this was a highly intense but violent movie . but it shouldnt have been a surprise because it was rated x in the beginning cuz of the violence . its a guy movie for sure but ive watched it a few times .
positive	a lot of people really hate this movie . i personally love it . i think astrophysics is really cool . this was released in 1997 when everyone was crazy about aliens . the motif isn't as popular now , so it may not be so appealing , but it's still a great movie . jodie foster does an excellent job . the film explores galactic communication through matehmatical signals , possible space travel , and the conflict between science and religion . it's entertaining and very well-made , and it really causes the viewer to reflect on what he or she really believes , as some things are open to interpretation . i'd say this is a must-see .
positive	one of my personal favorites . steve mcqueen is a god ! ! the acting is great , the story is great , and the music is great . everything is fantastic ! it's filled with action and has a cool motorcycle chase scene . what else do you need ?
positive	this is one beautiful movie , i tell you guys . it deserves a five . i can see it over and over and over and over and over again . i never get bored of this true beautiful story .
positive	7 days ! ! !
negative	mariah carey is in this movie and it absolutely sucks !
negative	this was a comedy ? i guess the joke was getting a studio to front the money for this wretched garbage .
positive	the best horror film ever . easily . great acting ; great directing ; great thrills ; great chills ; great film .
positive	i was really impressed by this movie . the story line was great with a lot of emotion .
positive	sean connery plays a desert bandit who kidnaps an american widow and her two kids . it is 1904 . brian keith plays a great teddy roosevelt who sends the marines . they land and shoot up the ruler's palace , hold him for ransom and get back the americans . it is loosely based on history but really great fun in the main . the scenes between candace bergen and connerty sometimes get a little draggy , but you can fast forward past those .
positive	i watch this every time it's on tv ! it's so funny , the actors are great , and it has some of the funniest jokes ever . i love milton , who always mumbles about his stapler , and eventually burns down the building !
positive	this was a good movie about how some women get paid for doing a job as a bartender . there is a good plot for her singing career . she never gave up .
positive	see if you can figure out why the birds kill people . if you can't , the story is my daphne du maurier , and hitchcock edited out the final scene in the film ( which explained ) .
positive	wow ! this movie is my all time favorite movie . it contained everything a good movie should . emotion , comedy , and romance . i would reccomend this movie to anyone ! ! because it is the best ever !
negative	i respect anyone who has had the guts to make as many come backs as the olsens have , but i am just not into their new stuff .
negative	a textbook example of how to make a bad movie out of a good book .
positive	this movie is so endearingly honest that you can tell cameron crowe is truly trying to get it all out and really express himself . i could really feel the amount of emotion he put into it , including his love of the rock and roll classics . it has an understated tone to it which is probably what i liked most about it .
positive	this is an excellent movie and mel gibson's finest . don't be scared away by the length of the film . it has great action and it flies by . you'll also be amazed by how great the large battles scenes are . they may have a little too much violence for some , but they are truly a tremendous directorial feat . braveheart is funny at times , but is also has a lot of heart .
positive	saw this film today and it is incredible . a perfect portrayal of the gospel and all that jesus christ suffered so that we can accept him as lord and go to heaven when we die . well done , mel gibson !
positive	i love all the lethal weapon films and although this one is not my favorite of the series , i still thought that is was a great film . it combined drama and action perfectly , and we can truly get inside the character's heads and understand their emotions . mel gibson does a wonderful job of portraying riggs's eccentric , somewhat troubled personality to the audience . danny glover is perfectly cast as the grouchy murtaugh who has his own insecurities about his age . the chemistry that glover and gibson share is simply amazing and it really perfected the film . and boy , what a creepy performance by gary busey . then again , i guess it's not hard for him to take on creepy roles . in the final analysis , lethal weapon is definately one worth watching , and be sure to catch the rest of the films as well .
positive	i liked the girl . lots of action . good graphics and stunts . i liked the cars .
negative	good grief ! it's a zero ! a re-make of the seventies flick that went out of date in the seventies ! three boobs given superhuman capabilities to beat up on all the bad guy's ? gimme a break !
positive	this must be the best movie of the 90's . from the scene when the doctor and his wife are at the mansion and the lights are glistening , to cruise walking the streets , or when he is trying to discover what is happening , the whole film is a visual treat . ok , the last scene could be ditched and simply leaves a tired ending , but apart from that the film cannot be faulted .
negative	the godfather movies deserve nothing except to be destroyed and put out of their forsaken misery .
positive	this was a great rendition of a great book . the mood , story , music and acting all fit together great . it was violent , but contained an important message while pushing the envelope .
positive	it was a romantic but yet realistic expression of love .
positive	when a comedy is clever it is good , when it takes a well known subject , pulls it to pieces , puts it back together again through the minds of six genius it can only be described as brilliant !
positive	a great , great movie . chevy chase and bill murray at the funniest ! kill the golfers !
negative	worst movie i have ever seen . if you find yeast infections , vulgar language and men nursing off a stranger entertaining , you will love it .
positive	one of the best sci-fi movies to date . great graphics and good story as well . the storyline is unique . interesting movie , must see .
positive	i really enjoyed this movie . there were so many famous people and i think that made it more interesting . it is a really funny movie and definitely worth going to see .
positive	i was shaky about giving this movie five stars , but deep down , i think it's worth it . it's fine storytelling . okay , the kingpin is a little too mu-hu-ha-ha-ha sometimes , and the carnage of the fight scenes tends to detract from the characters' identities . . . if only you could have two and a half hours of posturing and line delivery , like you do in the comics . to some extent , elektra is just a girl with sais , daredevil is just a creep in a kinky costume , and kingpin is just a hood . bullseye is just deranged , and he's a lot of fun . but this movie's got heart , and it's incredibly well shot and timed out , and it has a great sense of humor . it stays faithful to the comic as much as it can , with affleck ( p-u ) nailing murdock , who more or less is a mannequin in the books , when not flaying somebody's ass . the supporting characters are extremely well done , almost to the point of overkill , and everybody in the movie seems to be willing to bring this silly superhero story to life . of all the comic book vigilantes ever to hit the screen , this torn up , beat up , drugged up , messed up guy is the best and most believable , and maybe the most cheerable . a definite must see .
negative	aweful . this movie's story was so insulting ! jet had some pretty sweet fight scenes , but if that is all i wanted to see i would go down to the local dojo . if you like blood and wwf-like drama , this movie is for you . if you want something for your ticket price , then go see something else !
positive	munson , i certainly agree with you . kramer vs . kramer is a wonderfully touching film , and justin henry as the seven year old involved in a custody battle , is brilliant . i think this is one of hoffman's best films as well . the way his and meryl streep's characters are shown as mostly vindictive toward the other , but with an underlying compassion as well as thinking of the child , adds substance to the story . i applaud kramer vs . kramer for depicting divorce through a child's eyes so well , that surely even the more hardened of hearts will be affected by it . the best motion pictures do more than merely entertain ; they enlighten . bravo !
positive	the cell what can i say it was the best scary i've seen all year
positive	i thought this was a great movie . while i totally disagree with the events that happen , i thought it was hilarious .
positive	another kubrick masterpiece . r . lee ermey totally makes the film what it is by doing a fantastic performance as the drill instructor .
positive	animal house for the 90's
positive	i think scream is one of the most creative horror movies ever created . they make it feel like you know what's happening , then all of a sudden they give you a big twist at the end and it leaves you really stunned .
positive	great fantasy story ! there are very few fantasies out there that come close to the sense of awe and wonder this film projects . e . t . is the only one that comes to mind . add that to the fact that it is has been branded onto our culture in the same vein as films like gone with the wind , casablanca , psycho and others . great performances , excellent visuals , interesting situations and some great songs ! it all adds up to one great film !
negative	i tried , i really tried . . . it's too dated . unwatchable . i'll never go hungry again ! yikes .
